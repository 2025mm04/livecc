The horse responds by moving his hindquarters over while keeping his front legs in place. This shows that the horse is responsive to the rider's aids and is able to perform the movement correctly.\n\nAnother important aspect of medium-level dressage is developing the horse's balance and collection. This means that the horse should be able to carry himself in a balanced and compact position, with his weight evenly distributed between his front and hind legs. In the video, you can see that the horse is maintaining a good balance and collection as he performs the leg yield and shoulder-in movements. His hind legs are stepping under his body, and his front legs are reaching forward, which shows that he is developing the strength and balance needed for more advanced movements.\n\nFinally, at the medium level, it's important to start developing the horse's ability to perform more complex movements, such as half-passes and tempi changes.

The shortstop fields it and throws it to first base, getting the batter out. The next batter comes up and hits a line drive to left field. The left fielder catches it for the final out of the inning. Creighton was unable to score any runs this inning, but they'll get another chance in the next inning."}

It's clear that he's putting in a lot of effort, even though it may not look as difficult as some of the other exercises he's done in previous weeks.

He's showing us how to defend against an opponent who is trying to take him down with a single leg takedown. Vic is on his knees, and his opponent is attempting to lift him up by grabbing his leg.\n\nVic explains that in wrestling, it's all about getting to the next position faster than your opponent. So when his opponent isolates his leg, Vic knows he needs to get there faster too. He shows us how to crawl our hands towards the leg that the opponent has, and then scissor our feet to land perpendicular to the opponent's shoulder.\n\nVic emphasizes the importance of flexing the hamstring when landing, as this will prevent the opponent from bailing out and getting back into a single leg takedown. He also mentions that in freestyle wrestling, you can hold the opponent's arm, but in folkstyle, you just need to maintain control.\n\nOverall, Vic is giving us some great tips on how to defend against a single leg takedown and turn the tables on our opponent.

He waits for the perfect moment to pop up on his board, allowing gravity to do most of the work for him. This is a great strategy for catching waves easily, as it conserves energy and reduces the risk of falling off the board.\n\nOne thing to note is that John John is able to read the wave very well. He knows exactly where the steep section is and how to position himself to take advantage of it. This is a skill that comes with experience and practice, but it's something that all surfers can work on improving.\n\nAnother important aspect of John John's technique is his ability to stay relaxed and fluid on the board. He doesn't tense up or panic when he's negotiating the steeper sections of the wave, which allows him to make smoother transitions and maintain his balance.\n\nOverall, John John Florence's wave-catching technique is a great example of how patience, timing, and fluidity can help you catch waves more easily and ride them with confidence."}

You want to focus on the ball as it approaches you, and keep your eye on it until you make contact. This will help you time your swing correctly and hit the ball with precision.\n\nAnother important tip is to use your legs. Many players rely too much on their arms to generate power, but your legs are actually your biggest source of power. Make sure to bend your knees and use your leg strength to drive the ball forward. This will give you more power and control over your shots.\n\nFinally, practice your follow-through. A good follow-through is essential for maintaining balance and control after hitting the ball. Make sure to finish your swing with a smooth, fluid motion, and keep your eye on the ball until it leaves your racket. This will help you hit more consistent and accurate shots."}

Now, I'm right-handed, so my right hand is my dominant hand. And when I'm hitting the ball, I want to make sure that my right hand is in control of the shot. That means my right shoulder is going to be lower than my left shoulder, and my right elbow is going to be bent. Now, if you're left-handed, it's going to be the opposite. Your left shoulder will be lower, and your left elbow will be bent. But the principle is the same. You want to make sure your dominant hand is in control of the shot. And how do you do that? Well, you're going to drop your hitting shoulder down, and you're going to bend your elbow. And that's going to give you the power and the control you need for your forehand. So remember, dominant hand in control, elbow bent, and shoulder dropped. That's tip number four."}

You can see Mo Farah is lying on his back with his knees bent and feet flat on the ground. He's holding a medicine ball across his chest, which adds resistance and engages the core muscles even more. The exercise he's about to demonstrate is called oblique crunches, and it targets the muscles on the sides of your abdomen. Mo is going to do 20 repetitions of this exercise, and as he does, he's going to twist his torso from side to side, bringing the medicine ball towards his shoulder each time. Remember to keep your core tight and control the movement throughout. This exercise is great for building strength and stability in your core, which is essential for runners like Mo to maintain good form and prevent injuries.

The liver shot, when executed correctly with the left hand for a right-handed fighter or the right hand for a southpaw, can cause immense pain and potentially knock out an opponent. The spleen shot, on the other hand, can lead to serious internal injuries and is known to incapacitate fighters quickly.\n\nWhen practicing these shots, it's crucial to focus on proper technique.

It's also important to keep the head and upper body moving to avoid counterattacks.\n\nIn the video, we see the individual demonstrating the proper stance and movement required for delivering an effective liver shot and spleen shot.

The rod is a seven-foot medium-heavy extra-fast action, which is perfect for me because I like a stiffer rod. The reel is an eight-ball bearing system with an 8:1 gear ratio, which is great for quick retrieval. The drag works well, and the Evolve grip handle is comfortable to hold. The combo is rated for 8 to 14-pound line and can handle lures up to 3.8 ounces. I got this combo for around $75 on sale, which is a great deal. Let's get out on the water and put it to the test. Alright, I've got a fish on! This rod is working great, and the reel is smooth. I can tell already that this is a high-quality combo. I'll keep you guys updated as we continue to fish."}

Many times players will hit the ball in the net because they're not getting enough racket head speed. And racket head speed comes from the rotation of the hips and the shoulders. So when you're hitting your forehand, remember to rotate those hips and shoulders. The more you can rotate, the more racket head speed you'll get, and that will help you clear the net. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"Tom, how do I rotate my hips and shoulders?\" Well, it's simple. When you're in your ready position, your feet should be shoulder-width apart. And when you go to hit the ball, your front foot should step into the shot, and your back foot should pivot on the balls of your feet. That will allow you to rotate your hips and shoulders, and get that racket head speed. And remember, the more you rotate, the more power you'll get on your forehand.

After you've made contact with the ball, your racket should continue to move upwards and across your body. The follow-through is important because it helps to generate power and control in your shot. A good follow-through also helps to prevent injuries by allowing your body to naturally decelerate after the swing. Remember, the follow-through should be smooth and fluid, not abrupt or jerky. Practice your follow-through until it becomes second nature, and you'll see an improvement in your forehand technique."}

Now, this is a great exercise for targeting the triceps, especially the long head of the tricep muscle. I'm using a rope attachment, which allows me to get a nice stretch at the bottom of the movement and really squeeze the triceps at the top.\n\nI'm also making sure to keep my elbows close to my body and not letting them flare out too much. This helps to isolate the triceps and take some of the stress off of the elbow joint. I'm going for a higher rep range here, aiming for about 12-15 reps per set. This is going to help me build some muscular endurance and really pump up those triceps.\n\nRemember, when you're doing tricep pushdowns, it's important to keep your core tight and your upper body stable. You don't want to be swinging the weight or using momentum to complete the reps. Nice controlled movements are key to getting the most out of this exercise.\n\nAlright, I'm going to finish up this set and move on to the next exercise.

The rider in the blue jersey is a great example of someone who is effectively using their body weight to their advantage. Notice how they shift their weight forward and down onto the handlebars when seated, this helps to maximize power output and maintain stability on the bike.\n\nWhen the gradient steepens, you'll often see riders stand up out of the saddle. This allows them to use their leg muscles more efficiently and generate more power. However, it's important to remember that standing for too long can be tiring, so it's best to alternate between sitting and standing to conserve energy.\n\nThe rider in the black jersey is doing a good job of alternating between sitting and standing. They're also keeping their upper body relaxed, which is key to conserving energy. You want to avoid tensing up your shoulders and neck, as this will only waste energy that could be better used for pedaling.\n\nAnother thing to note is the importance of cadence. Keeping a high cadence, or pedal speed, is crucial for efficient climbing. The rider in the white jersey is spinning their legs quickly, which helps to keep the power output consistent and reduces the risk of burning out.\n\nFinally,"}

The rider in the blue jersey is a great example of someone who is using the technique effectively. He stays seated for the flatter parts of the climb, pedaling steadily and conserving energy. When the gradient steepens, he shifts his weight and stands up on the pedals, using his body weight to help propel him forward. This is a smart strategy because it allows him to tackle the toughest parts of the climb with more power, while also giving his back muscles a brief respite.\n\nNotice how the other riders are doing something similar. They too are shifting their weight and standing up when needed, which shows that this technique is widely adopted among experienced cyclists. It's important to remember that climbing out of the saddle should be done in short bursts, as it is more energy-intensive. You want to use it strategically, not exhaust yourself too early in the climb.\n\nThe key takeaway here is to be smart about your energy management. Stay seated as much as possible, but don't be afraid to get out of the saddle when you need that extra push.

Martin Truex Jr. just clipped Chase Elliott's nose and sent both cars into the fence at Darlington. The contact was so hard that it looked like the cars were going to flip over. I can't believe Chase gave up the inside line like that. He must have thought he had enough speed to clear Truex, but he didn't. Now, both cars are heavily damaged, and I'm not sure if they'll be able to continue the race. Truex knew that was his chance to take the lead, and he went for it, but it was a risky move.

This will leave you in the best position to push downwards when you're out of the saddle, enabling a smooth movement.\n\nThe commentator also advises gently rocking the bike from side to side by pushing it to the left when your right leg is pressing down and to the right as your left leg goes downwards. This technique uses gravity to assist in the movement, making it easier to maintain for long periods.\n\nFor those new to cycling, the commentator reassures that it's normal to feel the need to shift in and out of the saddle frequently.

The instructor uses her hands to illustrate the concept, pointing downwards to indicate the direction the seat bones should be facing.\n\nShe then shows how rounding the back changes the position of the seat bones, causing them to point in a different direction. This change in posture can lead to incorrect riding techniques, such as lifting the thighs off the saddle and losing the proper lower leg position. The instructor stresses that this can result in the rider losing their balance and not being able to effectively communicate with the horse.\n\nThe instructor introduces the concept of \"line three,\" where the rider has completely lost the correct posture, and \"line one,\" where the muscles are correctly engaged around the back. She explains that the thighs need to rotate in and \"snug in\" to create an A-frame around the horse, providing the ideal hold.

This is going to be a cable fly, and I'm using 45 pounds on each side. Last week, I was doing 60 pounds, so it's a significant drop in weight, but again, this is a deload week, and the goal is not to lift as heavy as possible, but to still get some work in and make sure that my muscles are getting the stimulation they need. I'm doing two sets of 12 reps, and I'm really focusing on squeezing my chest at the top of the movement. It's important to keep the form tight and controlled, even though the weight is lighter. You can see that I'm pausing for a second at the top of each rep to really engage the muscle. This is a great way to ensure that you're targeting the right area and getting the most out of your workout.

One of the most important things to remember is that you want to stay balanced over your skis throughout the turn. This means that your weight should be evenly distributed between both skis, with a slight emphasis on the inside ski during the turn.\n\nAs you start to initiate the turn by tipping the ski, you'll notice that your body will naturally want to lean into the turn. This is good! It means you're starting to engage the right muscles and movements. However, it's important not to let your body get too far ahead of your skis. You want to keep your upper body relatively quiet and stable, while your lower body does the work of turning the skis.\n\nAnother key thing to remember is to keep your knees bent and flexible. This will help you absorb any bumps or irregularities in the snow and maintain control throughout the turn.

The liver shot, delivered with the left hand for a right-handed boxer or the right hand for a southpaw, aims to strike the liver just below the floating ribs on the opponent's right side. This punch can be devastating, often causing the opponent to double over in pain and potentially leading to a knockout.\n\nThe spleen shot, on the other hand, targets the spleen located on the left side of the body. This punch can cause significant internal damage and is known to result in painful after-effects for the recipient, such as bruising or even bleeding.\n\nWhen executing these shots, it's crucial to maintain proper form and technique. The boxer should step offline slightly, dip their weight down onto the lead leg, and then push off the foot while punching upwards into the target area. The motion is akin to shoveling, where the boxer digs in and throws the punch over their shoulder.\n\nFor the spleen shot, the process is similar but involves stepping outwards for better balance.

This magnet is going to allow me to quickly and efficiently attach a magazine to my belt without having to fumble with it or look down at it. This is especially important in competition shooting where every second counts.\n\nNow, let's talk about the technique for picking up magazines from a table. You want to approach the table with your gun in hand, and your non-dominant hand ready to pick up the magazines. As you reach for the magazines, keep your eye on the target and maintain a firm grip on your gun.\n\nOnce you have picked up the magazines, use the magnet to attach one to your belt. Then, reload your gun and engage the targets. Remember, practice makes perfect, so be sure to practice this technique until it becomes second nature to you.\n\nIn summary, using a magnet on your competition belt can save you valuable time in attaching magazines, allowing you to focus on your shooting technique and ultimately improve your performance in competition."}

First, let's talk about the installation process. It was pretty straightforward, but you do need to have some basic tools and knowledge of how to work on your bike. The hardest part was probably bleeding the brakes, but even that wasn't too bad with the right tools.\n\nNow, let's get to the performance. I can already tell a huge difference in stopping power compared to the M200 brakes. These SLX brakes are much more responsive and give me a lot more confidence when riding at high speeds or on technical terrain. The modulation is also much better, which means I can control my speed more precisely without locking up the wheels.\n\nI've been riding with these brakes for a few days now and they're holding up great. No signs of wear or damage, and they're still performing like champs. I'm really impressed with the quality and performance, especially considering the price I paid.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend these Shimano SLX brakes to anyone looking to upgrade their bike's stopping power without breaking the bank.

The Steelers are on offense, facing a 3rd and 1 situation. The quarterback hands the ball off to the running back, who tries to push through the Broncos' defense. He manages to get a few yards, but it looks like he might be stopped short of the first down marker.\n\nThe Broncos' defensive line is doing a great job of clogging up the middle, making it difficult for the Steelers' running back to find any room to run. The linebacker comes in to assist and makes the tackle, bringing the runner down just shy of the sticks.\n\nThis is a crucial stop for the Broncos, as it forces the Steelers into a 4th down situation. The Steelers will have to decide whether to go for it or punt the ball away. The Broncos' defense has been stout all game, and this stop could really swing the momentum in their favor."}

Remember, keep your weight distributed evenly. Don't put all your weight on one side. You want to be able to move fluidly. So you're here, and you're going to use your arms to control his head and his arm. You can use your arm to push down on his shoulder, and your other arm to control his head. You're going to bring your knee up, and you're going to start to pass his guard. Keep your posture up, and don't let him sweep you. You're in control now. You've got the dominant position.

Kevin's got great symmetry here, his arms are well-developed and his vascularity is on point. The separation in his biceps is impressive, and you can tell he's put a lot of work into his forearms as well. Moving on to the back double biceps, we see that same level of detail and muscle definition. His lats are wide, and his lower back muscles are well-defined, which really helps to accentuate his overall physique. Now, let's take a look at the side chest again, and I want to emphasize how well Kevin has developed his pectoral muscles. The thickness and roundness of his chest give him a very balanced look. And finally, the most muscular pose. Kevin's quadriceps are massive, and his calves are well-defined, showing off his lower body strength. Overall, Kevin's physique is top-notch, and with a few tweaks to his conditioning, he could really be unstoppable on stage."}

{"video_id": "7_bHCx_Rchs", "event_id": 8, "begin": 58.274, "end": 68.583, "pred": "The video continues with a demonstration of the correct and incorrect postures for riding. The instructor, standing in front of the horse, explains the importance of the position of the seat bones and how it affects the rider's posture. She asks the rider to hollow their back and then come to a neutral position, which will make the seat bones point straight down. The instructor emphasizes that when the rider rounds their back, the seat bones will point differently, leading to an incorrect posture. She uses the analogy of \"flashlights on your seat bones\" to help the rider visualize the correct position. The instructor also mentions that many riders are taught to take their thighs off the saddle and have their lower leg on, which can result in poor posture. The video shows three lines representing different levels of losing the correct posture, with line three being the most extreme. The instructor stresses the importance of keeping the muscles snugged around the back to maintain the correct posture."}

Ryan just landed a trick that looked like it was going to end in disaster, but he managed to pull it off.

I need to land something big to keep up with Ryan's momentum. I'm thinking about trying a kickflip, but I'm not sure if I can pull it off on this carpet.
