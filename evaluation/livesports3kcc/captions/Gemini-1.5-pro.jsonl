So once I've warmed up with those leg yields and shoulder-ins, which are go-to lessons that should be part of your daily routine, just like brushing your teeth. The horse learns to be symmetrical in his body, learns to follow my aids the same on each side, and learns to accept my seat bones evenly. From there, we want to go to straightness. Now you're probably thinking, well, straightness is more of a beginner thing. You want to go straight. But actually, straightness is really an advanced topic. Because you can't go straight unless your horse is symmetrical. And you can't go straight unless you can feel when he's not straight. And that's one of the things that really divides the medium level riders from the more advanced riders. Feeling when your horse is crooked and being able to correct it within the gait without having to make a big production out of it. So in the beginner level, I teach people to do a square turn.  Make sure your horse is really straight on your short diagonal, and then go into your corner, and then ride a square turn. Here,  I don't really want to see anything, in particular, I just want to make sure that you're thinking about your horse being straight. At the medium level, what I want to see is that you can keep your horse straight from your seat. So this is where those half-halts that you've been practicing and practicing, they're going to come into play. So I'm going to ride across the diagonal and when I feel my horse drifting one way or the other, and it's a feeling, I'm going to straighten him with a half-halt. So again, I position my body where I want his to go. And when I feel him drifting, I'm going to use a half-halt to correct it. I'm not going to pull on one rein or the other, I'm going to use a half-halt. And the more advanced you get as a rider, the less you're going to have to do that, because he's going to learn to stay between your seat bones and your hand. Okay, good boy. And again, make sure you're doing it on both reins because your horse is probably going to drift to one side or the other. And I want you to notice when he drifts and what it feels like."}

In this case, he's a little bit heavier on my left rein, and that's the rein that he wants to hide behind a little bit, so I have to be very aware, with my left leg and my left rein, that I'm not allowing him to do that. That's one of the great things about leg yield, you can really feel when you go to do it, whether the horse is escaping through one rein or the other, if he's truly in front of both legs, or if he's hiding a little bit from one leg or the other.

In the second method, the belaying hand is below. This is mainly used when belaying the follower. If the climber falls, the guide hand pulls the rope in and the HMS locks automatically.

Let's actually compare the face of the wave here. So if we were to draw a line here, look at the distance from here to here, right? Pretty big distance. Now if we go to where he takes off, and we draw a line, there's a much smaller face there. And that just means that the wave is much steeper at this point in time than it is down here. So if he's able to make this wave, good on him because that's, this is definitely next level surfing. But when you're starting out, you don't want to try and take off on a wave like this and just give it one little stroke. You're going to want to give it a couple extra paddles to ensure that you're going to make it down this transition and you don't pearl. But that's it for John John Florence.

Okay, last one. Let's make it a good one.  Right, I'll pop the numbers up, let you guys see how it went overall. And, well, let's have a chat about it. So, guys, as you can see, the numbers are pretty good. Carried it 254, a little bit of wind helping with that, total of 266, launch was nice, good height, didn't feel like I had to really hit up on it. One thing you do notice is, as you'd expect with the smaller head, it's not as forgiving. You are going to lose a little bit of ball speed across the face, I think that shows in those numbers. Having said that, pretty impressed. What I probably would say, if you're somebody that's using a regular M2 3 wood, is don't necessarily go for this without trying it. But if you're somebody who's always liked the look of the tour stuff, wanted a little bit more workability, didn't want to sacrifice forgiveness, because like I said, it's still a very forgiving club, but wanted a little bit more workability, then this could be the club for you. So, guys, I'll put some links down below, both the regular M2 and the M2 Tour. I'm sure there'll be links for drivers and all sorts down there for you guys to have a look at.

As I mentioned in that video, depending on whether your start is an unloaded start or loaded and on the table, it might make more sense to actually load your gun on the table instead of inserting a full magazine. Now back to how to pick up multiple magazines from a table. Generally, there are two options or two techniques you can use. You can either pick them up individually. You grab the first mag, you insert it into the gun. You grab the second mag, you insert it into your magazine pouch. or you can opt to pick up multiple magazines at once. Now for the second option, to work efficiently, it requires a little bit of practice. You really want to ensure that when you pick up the mags, they are oriented in the same direction. You have a nice solid grip, and you're able to actually perform that technique without fumbling, dropping mags, or dropping your gun. In this case, we're going to assume an unloaded start. The gun is unloaded and on the table, and I will have to load and engage the targets. Let me demonstrate the technique.  Make sure it's safe, range is clear.  As you can see, I picked up two magazines. The first one was inserted into the gun, the second one was placed in my magazine pouch, and from that point, I engaged the targets. Now let me show you the technique again. And this time I will slow it down for you.  Make sure it's safe. Range is clear. So this is the technique I personally use. Of course, you can adapt it to your own preferences. You can use different finger positioning, you can use a different amount of mags, but the bottom line is,  this technique allows you to shave off a few tenths of a second compared to picking up magazines individually. And remember every tenth of a second matters. That's all for today. I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you at the range. Thank you for watching."}

It's extremely important to keep your weight low and centered as you approach the obstacle. If you lean back at all when you lift the front wheel, the rear wheel is going to want to come up too soon. Instead, you really want to push the bars forward as you lift them. Once you feel comfortable lifting the front wheel over the obstacle, you can then practice the rear wheel lift. You want to think about bringing your feet up towards your butt. A lot of people make the mistake of trying to jump by pushing down on the pedals and then pulling up on the bars. Not only does this take more effort, but it makes it much harder to control your bike. This is a very natural motion that should feel similar to jumping up off the ground. Notice that this time the bike is more level. That's because we are pulling the bike up and not trying to jump off of it. Once you feel comfortable with both of these techniques you can then combine them together."}

So we're gonna do that again. So trot across the diagonal. When you get to the quarter line, back to walk. Keep your inside leg at the girth. Good. And walk. Halt. Good. I like that. Pat him. Good boy. So when he halts, you have to give him the reins a little. Otherwise, he thinks he's supposed to back up. Okay. So one more time. Trot. Keep your hands quiet. Yes, that's much better. Good. And walk. And halt. Yeah. Much better. Good boy. Okay. So now what I want you to do, instead of walking when you get to the quarter line, I want you to make a nice working pirouette to the right. Okay? And then continue on down the long side. All right. So trot. Keep your leg on, keep your leg on. Good. And pirouette. Good. Beautiful. That's really nice. Okay, back to walk. And halt.

They've got every confidence. He's already won a Nations Cup this year. They were victorious in La Baule. Fence seven, and it's looking really good now for the Dutch. They needed a steady round. They couldn't have asked for more than that. That's 12 fences, 12 perfect jumps from Marc Houtazager. And just the last few now. It's looking so good for the Dutch.

Specifically, we're looking at a nasty variation, the armless D'Arce choke, starting from the triangle setup.  \n\nOur instructor is demonstrating the importance of control. Notice how he has his opponent's arm isolated, keeping him flat on the mat. This is crucial, folks. You need that tight control before you can transition to the armless D'Arce. He's going to use his legs to create a frame, preventing any escape.  \n\nNow, watch this transition!  He's sliding his knee up, almost like he's going for a traditional triangle, but instead of locking his ankle behind the knee, he's feeding his arm through, trapping the opponent's arm against the neck. This is where the armless D'Arce comes into play. \n\nHe's cinching it up tight now, using his hips to generate power. Remember, it's not just about squeezing with your arms; it's about using your entire body. He's putting his weight on his opponent, making it almost impossible to escape. This is textbook, folks.\n\nAnd there it is! A beautiful, technical submission. The armless D'Arce is a high-percentage attack from the triangle setup, and this demonstration shows exactly why.  Remember the key points: control, transition, and leverage.  Keep practicing this one; it could be a game-changer for your submission game."}

I'm gonna freeze the action. So I'm taking my racket back. I'm coming a foot below the contact point, racket face slightly closed.

So if you look at the racket face right now, I know it's a little hard to see, but that racket face is vertical, and I'm just about to make contact with the ball, the equator of the ball right there.

You know, we can't, you know, you can't like get married to, oh, it has to happen exactly like this, because that's not the way reality is. Reality is going to be a little bit different. And that goes back to this attrition rate, right? You know, we talked about principles before we started filming. We're talking about attrition rate. The reality is you're going to start losing techniques, concepts, ideas, the further you get away from training. So that's why it's important to, you know, train consistently. But even beyond that, that's why it's important to have a very, very good, solid understanding of the principles and the mechanics. You know, like if you just get caught up in techniques, like, okay, well, he grabbed my wrist here. This is what I do. And that's all you know. Well, guess what? As soon as he grabs you in a slightly different spot, you don't have an answer. And then what happens when you add the stress, the adrenaline, the fear, all these other things that are gonna come into play. It's going to make that attrition rate even higher.

That step back is crucial, it takes you out of their range while setting up your final strike. And look at the way the final punch rotates, generating power from the hips and core.

Do you guys think he's going to come in bigger and better than ever? Let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below. And the last story of today's video Steve Laureus being asked about his competition plans for this year and he says this year I'll be competing late summer still undecided I'm excited for this year. Now, that's really all the information that he gave us late summer, so that would probably put him maybe at the Texas Pro, the Chicago Pro. I'm not sure if the Tampa Pro is still happening this year or not, but those are a couple of late summer shows. Maybe the Arnold Classic USA if it happens in late September. So again, not too much to speculate on here, but I think this is positive news. I think it's positive to hear that Steve is planning on competing this year. I know a lot of people were excited about his comeback last year. He looked great. You know, unfortunately, it didn't pan out the way that we all hoped that it would. But I'm sure he learned a lot from last year and I'm sure he's going to be better prepared going into this year. So best of luck to Steve in his 2021 season.

Now you don't wanna overdo it, but you do wanna have it closed. Some players exaggerate it at first, but once they get the feel of the closed face, then they just close it slightly at the beginning, okay, and then it naturally becomes vertical. So those are your quick tips for the forehand, swing low to high, palm down or closed face, keep that racket vertical after contact.  We're talking about a foot to a foot and a half after contact, the ball's gone. At that point, you can let the wrist and forearm relax as you finish. So I hope those tips help your forehand."}

There's a little logo on every tennis ball. That's your target, right there. Watch the manufacturer's logo as you make contact, and try to make contact out in front of your body. Now, that distance is going to vary. Obviously if I'm hitting a really high ball above my shoulder, my contact point is going to be more in front. If I have a really low ball, my contact point's going to be a little closer. But the key is, watch that manufacturer's logo and make contact out in front. Alright? So we've got two tips now: the racket low, contact out in front, and watch the logo. Now, a lot of players, they get confused, they say, well how come on TV I see the pros, they hit the ball way out in front?  Well, the reason why they're doing that is because they're hitting the ball on the rise as it's coming up. So their contact point is further out in front, which gives them more power. Now that's something that you could work on. Maybe as you get more advanced, you can start taking the ball a little earlier, but for beginners and intermediate players, I would suggest contacting the ball, you know, just after the peak of the bounce out in front."}

Hurricanes doing enough at the moment in this tackle. Yeah, just. Just holding on, I think the ref's going to say there. Yep. Penalty coming. Sharks going to have a scrum feed, five meters out. Big moment. Yeah, and this is a big, big moment here. This could be the decider. This is where they need to get points because they were dominant there. So it's all on the line. Number eight picks up. Bosch. Little grubber kick. And the Sharks score. Oh, he's having a blinder, Curwin Bosch. They were held up over the line, weren't they, Drew? Quick thinking from Bosch.

I was pretty pumped with how that moved for just being a single. And then we've got some accessories here. We've got sumo block pulls off two mats. That's about an inch and a half deficit and then I've got my typical stiff leg deadlifts. I'll admit these are pretty brutal after all that squatting and deadlifting but I do think that they're necessary just to keep that posterior chain strong, keep my hamstrings feeling good and healthy, and they will make 585 on the platform feel like a feather.  So those are my goals today and they are what they are I did the best I could and  we're gonna keep grinding. Alright, so here's the sumo block pull. Just a single at 515.  Keep in mind I did already pull from the floor, conventional. So this is definitely not going to be like a true max effort type of pull but it's still good to kind of feel that heavier weight, just a little bit of a deficit. Really focusing on keeping my abs tight, getting set up properly, and having a really smooth pull off the blocks.  Pretty pleased with how that moved as well. And then here's the first set of stiff leg deadlifts. Just trying to stay as upright as possible, just really emphasizing the hamstrings, working on that hinge movement, and trying to keep everything tight and controlled.  I'm trying to keep these as strict and controlled as possible, especially this deep into meet prep.  Don't want to do anything stupid, just gotta be smart, keep the weight moving, keep it feeling good, and keep the intensity high. And then here's the second set of stiff leg deadlifts.  Lowering the weight just a tad to 365 for another set of eight.  Same thing, just focusing on good form and getting a good stretch in the hamstrings.  You can see it's getting a little bit tougher, but that's to be expected at this point in the workout.  And that's a wrap.  Overall, a really good day of training.

You can see that he's already starting to position himself a little bit differently, a little bit further out on the shoulder because he's expecting that wave to break a little bit further out. He knows that those waves are breaking at that outer sandbar. And he takes his positioning, and this wave, again, is going to be pretty similar in size to the last one, maybe a foot or two smaller, but it's still a pretty good size wave. It's still a wave that most people would be pretty intimidated by. And he's going to try to use the same technique. He's going to try to paddle in, get to his feet early, and then use that bottom turn to kind of set up his ride. So let's see what he does here. He's paddling in, he's paddling in. Now here's where the planning comes in. He's got to make a decision: Is he going to go or not? This wave's starting to break a little bit further out than he anticipated."}

Joel Tinney, the hero for Johns Hopkins. He had a goal with four seconds left in regulation to tie the game at 17. And then in overtime he finds Shack Stanwick, who rips one top shelf for the game-winner. What a win for the Blue Jays. They needed this one bad. They were on a two game losing streak. They were struggling. They really needed to get back on track. They pick up a huge win on the road against a top five opponent. It doesn't get much better than that if you're Johns Hopkins.

Man, the fans at Loretta's are something else. They're so passionate about motocross, and they really make the atmosphere electric. It's unbelievable. That moment when they handed me the number one board is something I'll cherish forever. It's a symbol of all the hard work, dedication, and sacrifice that went into achieving this championship. And it's a reminder that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. Man, look at those kids' faces.  Seeing them smile like that makes it all worth it. This championship wasn't just for me, it was for all the kids out there who dream of racing motocross. I wanted to show them that anything is possible if you dare to dream big and work hard.

So, feet are already back. We want to maintain a 90-degree angle. If she needs to bring her feet in a little bit more, that's fine, too. But I want her to think about driving her knees out, and I'm gonna give a little resistance to this. So, go ahead and feel that drive out, and I want you to maintain that drive the entire time. So, you're gonna feel a tremendous amount of tightness in your quads and in your hamstrings, depending on if your hamstrings want to work or not. So, go ahead and inhale up to that chest. Unrack. Good. And go. Re-breathe. All right. So, her butt did want to come up a little bit. Now, the bar path was a little bit better because her chest was already up. So, I am going to have you take two steps back a little bit. And I want you to, again, feel that knee drive. You're good. Relax. So, as we're going through this, think about maintaining that knee drive the entire time. You see how she's not moving? She's not budging. And then, inhale. Unrack. Good. Now, bench. And go. Good. Re-breathe. That's one. Go. Good, and rack. So, when we look at those reps, we can see a much better bar path because her chest was higher. We can see less hip extension because we were really pushing through those knees. Now, if this is something that you're struggling with, I want you to film yourself from this angle and this angle and notice how much more efficient she's getting the bar from point A to point B and back down because we're taking away that hip extension. Now, is she going to have to play with her foot placement to get the best leg drive possible? Absolutely. She's still learning. But this is a great way to do that. All right, guys.

This particular horse has a really good walk-halt transition. So it's fairly easy for me to stop him. He's a very responsive horse. And some horses find this very easy. Other horses find it much more difficult. If your horse finds it very difficult, it might take you a lot longer than the average training ride to teach your horse to stop. So I'm going to demonstrate on him. Good boy, good boy. You're doing great. Good boy. Again, I'm going to push him into the halt. Good boy. Good boy. I use my voice extensively. I think it's important to reward your horse, especially when they're learning something new. That was really good. Now, how does that translate into self-carriage? If I have a horse in a training level frame, in a long and low frame, in a medium level frame, or in a collected frame, in any frame at all, and I push him to the halt like that, and he stays in that frame to the halt, then I've achieved what I want. I haven't pulled him to the halt. I haven't restricted him to the halt. I've pushed him to the halt. And that's the essence of self-carriage. So, once you've taught your horse to do that from the walk, which can take quite a long time, and can be very frustrating, then you move it into the trot. Now I'm not going to do that with him. I wouldn't do that with him on a regular basis because this is not my horse. It's important for me to ride somebody else's horse as if it's somebody else's horse. Because I want the training that I'm doing to be very specific. So that every single thing I do on a daily basis with him is building to that self-carriage. So, if I get on him tomorrow, and he can stop a little bit better from the walk, then I might try it once from the trot. But I'm not going to drill and drill and drill and drill and drill, because all I'm going to do is create tension if he doesn't understand the question. So I hope those few tips will help you to understand what I mean by moving a beginning level horse or rider into a medium level horse or rider, which obviously is preparing them for the advanced level, and also the FEI levels. Thank you for watching."}

Now, don't let the name fool you; this isn't about serving after a few too many energy drinks. This is about a relaxed, loosey-goosey approach to the serve that can actually add some serious power and unpredictability to your game.\n\nOur player here is showcasing the essence of this technique. Notice how he's not wound up like a coiled spring.  Instead, he's starting with a relaxed grip and letting his arm hang freely. Think of it like a pendulum gathering momentum. \n\nThe key here is in the toss and the swing. It's all about timing and using your body's natural rhythm. See how he's almost letting the ball drop lower than usual? That allows him to generate power from his legs and core as he explodes upwards into the serve.\n\nThis relaxed approach can be a real game-changer, especially if you're prone to overthinking your serve. It can help you loosen up, find your natural rhythm, and unleash a serve that's got a bit of that \"I-woke-up-like-this\" swagger. \n\nOf course, mastering this serve takes practice. It's all about finding that sweet spot between controlled chaos and consistent power. But hey, that's part of the fun of tennis, right? Experimenting, tweaking, and finding what works for you."}

This year's course featured a challenging 40 kilometer ride with rolling hills. As you can see, the cyclists are heading out onto the open road. This section looks relatively flat, allowing athletes to find their rhythm and settle into a good pace after the swim. The scenery is fantastic; lush greenery and glimpses of the lake offer a welcome distraction from the physical exertion. Notice the cyclist up ahead, passing the traffic cone \u2013 that marks the turnaround point, meaning they're already halfway through this leg of the race. \n\nNow the course transitions away from the lakeshore and heads inland. This section of the bike course is known for some testing climbs. Looking at the elevation chart, you can see the infamous Lees Road climb coming up around the 5 kilometer mark \u2013 a 2 kilometer ascent with grades reaching 7 to 13%. It's a true test of endurance and strength. Then, after a brief respite, athletes face another climb as they navigate Northmount Road with its daunting 16% grade. This challenging terrain will really separate the strong riders from the pack.  But the reward for conquering these hills comes after the 16 kilometer mark, where the course transitions to a largely downhill run on Four Mile Lake Road.

Yeah, I'm sure she's disappointed leaving a few points on the table technically, but sometimes you just want to get through the long program cleanly in a comeback season, get the confidence and then build on that next time.

This is one of my favorite exercises for quads. I like to get a nice stretch at the bottom. You can see his stance here, medium stance, shoulder-width apart. A lot of people like to go real wide or real close. I like to stay somewhere in the middle. You don't want to lock out at the top. You want to make sure you're controlling the weight. You're not using your back or your butt to push the weight up, you're using all quads. Make sure you get a nice stretch at the bottom. And when you come up you're not going to lock out.

Also, think about what your body's doing whilst you're climbing. You don't want to be too rigid. Allow your hips to sway slightly with each pedal stroke and let your bike find its own way. This will feel strange at first, but with a bit of practice, it'll feel natural, and you'll be climbing much more efficiently as a result. When climbing out of the saddle, you recruit a larger muscle group to aid the effort and increase power. As you stand, shift your body weight slightly forward, almost over your handlebars. This will stop the rear wheel spinning out and help you to maintain traction. Keep pedalling smoothly whilst maintaining a steady cadence. Try to keep the bike as straight as possible. Avoid rocking it from side to side, as this is inefficient and a waste of energy. It can also be dangerous if you're in close proximity to other riders. When approaching a descent, shift up through the gears into a larger one. Stay relaxed and grip the handlebars lightly in the drops to maintain a lower centre of gravity, giving you greater control of the bike. By following these simple, straightforward techniques, you'll be amazed at how much more efficiently you'll climb, which after all is a battle against gravity. Ride smart and choose your moments to attack."}

I like to see that they're already confirmed in their gaits, in walk, trot, and canter. The horse is balanced and the rider doesn't have to work so hard, let's say, to keep the horse on a 20-meter circle. So in walk what I would expect at this level, what I would work on, is that the rider now becomes a little bit more aware of what the hind legs are doing. So I would expect that the rider can do a nice 10-meter circle in walk. And on that 10-meter circle I would expect that they can feel the hind legs and they can position the hind legs. So I would maybe do a quarter of the 10-meter circle in shoulder-fore. I would then do maybe another quarter in a little bit of a haunches-in. And then I would come out and I would do a nice, big stretch circle, still on my 10-meter circle. So walk is a very important gait at this level because the horses are already, let's say, confirmed in their gaits. They can do a little bit of lateral work. The riders now have to become aware of the hind legs. And there is no better gait than the walk to feel the hind legs."}

The key here is the hip hinge, pushing her hips back while maintaining that straight back. You should really feel the stretch in the hamstrings as you go down. Remember, it's not about how low you can go, but how much you can activate and engage those hamstrings and glutes."}

Today we're out in the field doing a First Strike test run with the FSC paintball pistol. This bad boy just launched, and it's already creating a buzz in the paintball community. As you can see, it's sleek, compact, and looks super cool. We're about to find out if it performs as good as it looks! We're going to run some First Strike rounds through it and see how it handles in terms of accuracy and range. Let's do this!\n\nOkay, I'm all set here. Target's up, safety's on, and I've got the FSC loaded with First Strike rounds. These rounds are known for their accuracy and distance, so I'm excited to see what this pistol can do. I'm aiming for the center mass of the target, about 20 feet out. Taking a deep breath, let's fire the first shot.  \n\n(After the first shot) BOOM! Did you see that? That was a direct hit, just a smidge off-center. Not bad for a first shot! This pistol definitely has some kick to it, but it's manageable. Let's try a few more rounds.\n\n(After subsequent shots) Wow! This pistol is surprisingly accurate! Most of the shots are clustered tightly around the bullseye. The First Strike rounds are definitely making a difference. I'm impressed with the range on this thing too. The rounds are traveling straight and true, even at this distance.\n\n(Concluding the test) Alright, guys, there you have it! The FSC paintball pistol firing First Strike rounds. Based on what I'm seeing here, this pistol is a winner. It's accurate, has decent range, and feels good in hand. If you're looking for a reliable sidearm for your next paintball game, you might wanna check this one out.

As you can see, it's a 20-minute AMRAP, meaning \"As Many Rounds As Possible,\" and our athlete today is aiming to squeeze in as many rounds of this grueling combo as she can. \n\nFirst up, a 400-meter run. Watch her explode off the line, powerful strides eating up the pavement. This initial burst is all about setting a strong pace and building a solid foundation for the round. \n\nNow, she's back and heading straight for the pull-up bar. Remember, the challenge here is \"Strict\" pull-ups, meaning no momentum or kipping allowed. It's all about raw, upper body strength! Notice her controlled movements, flawless form, each pull-up a testament to her dedication and power. \n\nShe's not just doing a set number of pull-ups each round, she's maxing out! That means pushing herself to the limit, squeezing out every last rep until her muscles scream for mercy. Talk about grit and determination! \n\nAs she cycles back to the run, you can see the fatigue setting in. But she's not letting it stop her!  This is where mental fortitude comes into play. It's about digging deep, pushing past the discomfort, and proving to herself what she's truly capable of.\n\n\"Strict Nicole\" is a true test of both physical and mental resilience. It's about pushing your boundaries, embracing the burn, and celebrating the small victories along the way.  So next time you're looking for a challenge that will push you to your limits, give \"Strict Nicole\" a try and see what you're made of. Remember, it's not about how many rounds you complete, but the fight you bring to each and every one. Now, let's cheer our athlete on as she conquers this beast of a WOD!"}

I mean, the ball speed's jumped up to 147 miles an hour. That's carrying 233. But look at that launch, 11 degrees. If we take that shot out and we look at the averages off the deck, 145 ball speed, which for me, swinging at 104, is plenty. Launch angle of 10.9, just under 11 degrees. Again, for me, with a 3-wood, that's ideal. I don't want to be launching it too high. I want something I can flight down if I need to, if it's windy. But more importantly for me, the spin, 2976. You know, we're looking at kind of 28, 2900 spin with a driver, so to be carrying it 233 yards, you know, 232, 233 on average, that's plenty long. That's going to be a perfect gap for me. Side spin, very, very good, very, very straight. Actually, if I look down the list of shots, you can see that one that I really felt like I drew, that's the one that's spun the most. That's kind of what I want to see. If I can hit the center of the club face, like I said, I don't feel like I really have with this as yet, I think that's only going to get tighter.

As you can see, our fighter is demonstrating the proper stance and guard, but we're going to focus on what happens when those punches land downstairs. \n\nFirst up, the liver shot. Aiming for the right side of the body, just under the ribs, this punch can be a fight-ender. A well-placed liver shot sends a shockwave through the nervous system, causing intense pain and often dropping opponents to their knees in agony. \n\nNow, on the left side, we have the spleen. Similar to the liver shot, a solid connection to the spleen can be excruciating and debilitating. \n\nRemember, these punches are all about precision and timing. We're not just looking for brute force here, but rather targeting these vulnerable areas for maximum impact. \n\nStay tuned as we dive deeper into the mechanics, strategies, and effects of these knockout body blows.

I haven't addressed that, but from here, I've got a couple of options. If he doesn't make a commitment to coming all the way up to his feet, I might be able to trap him down here. I might be able to pull guard and come up on top of him or trap the arm. Those are all fine, but I have to make sure that as he makes that transition back up, that I'm moving with him. The other thing is, as he comes up here, I could also, and this is an option you might want to entertain. If he starts to come up to here, then I can go ahead and trap that arm and bail out the back door if I need to. And so what I'm looking to do here is, if he starts to come up, I'm going to use this hand to trap that elbow down, and then I'm going to bail out this way. That's going to buy me some space.

So I'm going to show you in a minute what happens if you don't ride it that way. He does not yet understand the aid completely. He's young. Good boy. So you can see I can push him forward. Now let me show you what happens if I don't stop him. I push and push and push and push, and he gets lower and lower and lower. He might even start running a little bit if I don't stop him soon. And then he's on his forehand, not on his haunches. I'm going to try to stop him. Good boy, I'll take it. It wasn't perfect, but I'll take it. Okay, so it's a work in progress. I'm happy with what I feel. He's a little bit tense still because it's very early in the work. I think he's going to relax nicely. We're going to do some trot work next and you can see it all evolve in front of your eyes. And you can do this too, at home, with your horse. I am 100% convinced that if you follow these basic principles, you can take any horse, as long as he's healthy and sound, from a beginning level to a medium level and start to prepare for the advanced work which, when you start to do the advanced work, all you're really doing is asking for more collection and more expression in each gait. So we're going to move on to the trot work. You can see my horse is already starting to find a better rhythm. Good. And I'm going to go back to my leg yield. Because if I can get his body straight and symmetrical in the leg yield, then the shoulder in will get easier and easier each time. I do it. So, if you watch closely here, I'm going to make sure my horse will move off my left leg as well as he moved off my right leg in the last leg yield. And now we're going to do it on the left rein. Good boy, super, and then come straight again. Good. You can see he got a little tense in the neck. I'm going to repeat that. Good boy. He's trying so hard, you can see that. That's much better. Good boy. I am looking for the feeling that he is in front of my inside leg, in front of my outside leg, perfectly straight in my body. Good boy. Much better. Now I'm going to turn that into shoulder in. I'm going to cut my corner. I'm going to take my time. I'm going to touch him with the inside leg, and I'm going to allow the shoulders to come off the track. Good boy. And then I'm going to straighten him again before the wall. I'm going to turn that into a little bit more of a collected trot. Good. That's better. Good. And again, and again, just always repeating those same aids. Good. Making sure that I'm getting what I want. Good boy. Very nice. Good. And then we're going to move into the medium trot. I like to do medium trot and extended trot. I'm going to take a break from collection for just a minute and I want to make him as big and as loose as I can, in both directions. And the reason I do that is because I need him to understand, go forward from my seat and leg aids and then wait, and come back, and then go forward again. The more extreme I can make it, the easier it is for him to feel the difference.  So we're going to go back to that medium trot. Good boy. Good.  And then I'm going to collect. Good boy. Good, much better, super. Good boy, and then we'll go the other way. Now I can feel him starting to relax underneath me. Good boy, good. Very nice. Good boy. I don't love that transition, so I'm going to fix it in the next one. You saw how he dropped down a little bit in the front end? That's what I don't want, so I'm going to keep my inside rein a little bit steadier there. Good boy, much better.  Good, and then come back. Beautiful. And again. Good, and come back. Very, very nice. I'm going to take another shot at that down transition because I'm not thrilled with it yet. Good, much better. Good boy, that's super. You can see him getting more and more uphill. Every time he comes back, he gets more uphill. That's what I'm looking for. We are going to try the walk to canter transitions next and I am going to stop there for today because I think that's enough work for one session.

A common defense is for your opponent to keep their elbows tight to their ribs, making it difficult to separate the elbow for attacks like knee on belly or to sneak your arm in for submissions. Now, instead of getting frustrated and resorting to north-south, try this: place your bicep on their opposite elbow. This creates a small gap that you can exploit. If they try to drop their elbow or flatten out, put weight on their shoulder to force their back up, which in turn lifts their elbow. Now you can slide your arm in deeper and walk your hands towards their head, further exposing the arm. You can then lock your hands behind their head and use your belly to pull their other elbow up, giving you control of both arms. From here, you have options: attack either arm with a submission, transition to a more dominant position, or go for the choke.

Well, that was a really poor putt, wasn't it?  He just didn't hit it. Didn't hit it at all. So, a dropped shot for Fitzpatrick. He's back to 14 under par."}

I've got some fast rolling, lightweight wheels with me today, but you can also spec the bike with a slightly heavier, more robust wheelset with a dynamo hub in the front wheel. How cool is that? But you know what? Let's go and have a look at some other bikes. Let's have a look at what other people have chosen to ride today. So what we got here? We've got a lovely Cannondale SuperSix Evo. Look at that paint job. That is absolutely amazing. Love the Palace collab. That is super cool. Right, I'm gonna go find my bike before it gets dark. Catch you later. So, I've done about 50 kilometers now. Pretty knackered. I'm very glad I brought this bike to the event. The suspension fork has taken the sting out of all the rough terrain, made the downhills a lot more fun and a lot more confidence inspiring as well. Really, really enjoying this bike.

So what I need to do is when I step over, Jono, step over to here, yep, I need to fill that gap, so I take this leg here, and I just fill that gap. So what that does, it stops him from driving forward and collapsing my knee. If he drives forward now, I can keep my elbow high and tight, and it's very difficult. Go for it, try and drive forward, I can keep you out, you can't get past here. You can't get past my leg. That's because I'm using the strength of my skeleton. Yeah, so this is a real basic thing, but I find that even guys at my level, you know, I've had my black belt for a couple of years, guys are always getting chest to chest and I'm like, man, what happened to your shin?

He's lying on it with his stomach and chest on the ball, legs extended back, toes on the ground for balance. Look at the control he has, keeping his body in a straight line. Now, he's going for the Swiss ball opposite arm and leg lift. Lifting one arm straight out and the opposite leg simultaneously, this is serious core engagement! This move is all about control and balance, working those deep stabilizing muscles that are crucial for runners. He's doing five reps, nice and slow, focusing on that mind-muscle connection. Remember, it's not about speed, it's about precision and engaging those core muscles.  \n\nNow he's transitioning, smoothly moving into the lower back extension, still on that Swiss ball. His upper body drapes over the ball, creating a gentle stretch in the back. Now, he's engaging his lower back and glutes, lifting his chest up, creating that extension. Again, five reps, controlled and deliberate.  This exercise is fantastic for strengthening the lower back, which can be a weak point for many runners. A strong lower back helps prevent injuries and improves running form. Mo's really emphasizing quality over quantity here, and that's something we can all learn from.

And you can see here, we have a little representation of your reticle. This is an example of the Tremor3 reticle. You can see that little red dot there, that is our point of aim. If you look at the elevation, it's saying 6.3 mils up, and it's also saying .2 mils left, so that's how we got to that solution. Now, that's if you're going to use your reticle. If you want to use your turret, you simply slide over and you'll see there it says solution in MOA, but you can switch it to solution in mils, and that'll give you your turret adjustments as well.

This variant is therefore more suitable for heavy climbers. The advantage of holding the handbrake down is that the movement is more ergonomic and the hand gets tired less quickly. This variant is therefore particularly suitable for long climbing routes. If the climber wants to climb up again, always make sure that the handbrake cable runs above the carabiner. This ensures that the belayer can react immediately in the event of a fall and can hold the climber.  In principle, both variants of holding the brake hand are safe, as long as the basic principles of belaying are observed. These are: the brake hand never leaves the brake cable, the belayer always pays attention to the climber, and the belayer reacts immediately to a fall."}

But with 40km from the final climb to the finish, it might be difficult for a breakaway to stay away. Stage 5 is a 16km out-and-back individual time trial on the east coast in Tendring, Essex, providing the last real opportunity for the GC contenders to gain time. It is mostly flat, with just 122m of elevation in total, so will be a fast and furious race against the clock that will be decided by the narrowest of margins.

The last one felt like I actually gave it a little bit, probably caught that a bit out of the toe. I'd love to tell you it was intentional. It wasn't. However, the proof's in the pudding. Let's have a little look at some numbers and see exactly what these things did. So my first couple of shots, I said they felt quite good. Ball speed was quite high. I think the first one was 147 miles an hour, second one 145, little bit toe-y. However, my launch was quite high with those. I was getting about 13, 14 degrees launch and spin was about three and a half, which for me, if I can get those numbers, then we're going to be in business. I said I didn't feel like I'd quite hit the middle of any. Now, I was generally hitting up on the face a little bit. Nothing too drastic, but definitely up towards the top of the face. Last couple felt like I hit them okay, but again, didn't really feel like I hit the middle of anything. Numbers were still very, very good, though. I mean, if I can get that out on the golf course, I would happily put this thing straight in the bag. It felt good. Obviously, it's a very, very small sample size. We've hit six shots indoors, but that being said, I don't think you could ask for a lot more from those six shots, certainly in the launch conditions I was getting with that golf club. So there you have it, guys, brand new TaylorMade M2 Tour 3 wood. Hopefully, that's given you a little bit of an insight as to what this club is all about. As I said, I'll pop some numbers on the screen now, so you can have a little look at averages, see what the strike was like. But yeah, very impressed. Hopefully you found that useful.

That's it. So you guys see how that elevates her a little bit more. You can even see a little bit more definition in her upper back because she's pulling that air in. That's good. Drive your feet, there you go. Now we're talking. Good, so she took two reps there.  Take one more. Keep your upper chest up. Yep. That's it, perfect. And rack it. So you guys can already see a major difference, and we've only addressed one thing, breathing. That's something as simple as a breathing cue, and she's already in a better position. So the other thing I want you guys to pay attention to is when she brings that bar down, the bar path isn't completely vertical, but it's not so far out in front that she's doing almost a decline press. We want her elbows stacked over her wrists, because what that's gonna do is it's gonna help her use more triceps, it's going to keep her tighter, and it's going to shorten that range of motion. So, Lily, we're going to do this from the top down. I want you to unrack the bar. I want you to bring the bar down and touch right about, yep, right about there. A little bit lower, there you go. Now keep your butt down and try to drive up. And you see how her butt came up. Good, and rack it. Now, that wasn't because of anything else other than her trying to find that stability. She's trying to find that leverage to drive the weight up. So, we're going to do the same thing, but when you unrack this time, Lily, and you bring the bar down to your chest, you're going to tuck your elbows in a little bit more. You're gonna bring your elbows in towards your sides, take that same breath into your upper chest, and then drive straight up. You ready? Yep. Unrack, big breath, tuck, yep, drive. There we go. Now, that was much better. We're going to take three more reps like that. That's it, good. One more. Big breath, tight, good. And rack it. So you guys see that when she brings her elbows in a little bit more, she stays much tighter. She's able to use her triceps, she's able to drive the weight, and she's not having to use her lower body to get that extra drive. And the biggest thing that I preach to my lifters is efficiency, because if you can't be efficient in this lift, in any lift, you're leaving pounds on the bar. So I hope that these two little cues for you long limb lifters out there really helps you benefit on your bench. This is something that I've had to struggle with my entire life. Being 5'8\" with a 76-inch wingspan, it sucks, but there are ways around it. So again, this is Christian Anto with Elite FTS and Lily, and we will see you guys next time."}

Some beginners will pull up on the bars, only to push them forward, which cancels out the upward motion. The goal is to get the bars as close to your waist as possible. You can even imagine trying to touch your chest to the stem of your handlebars. Once you get to this point, you're basically just coasting through the air.  The final part is bringing your knees up to level out the bike. This may happen naturally as you pull up with your arms. However, if you need to gain more height, this is where you can use your legs to help. The best part about riding in Miami is you can bunny hop your way right to the beach."}

So at this point, I knew 675 was there. I knew my previous PR was there. The question was, would 700 be there? And the answer to that question was, I had no idea. But we are going to find out together right now. Now, the opening pull to this 675 was brutal. My back was absolutely screaming at me at this point. And the funny thing is, when I watch this back, it doesn't even look that bad. It just looks like I'm setting up for a heavy deadlift. But I guarantee you, everything inside was screaming. \nNow, this 675 went up, in my opinion, slower than the 585. So the reality was setting in that 700 pounds was going to be a fight. But what I did have on my side, was that this 675 felt about the same as my previous PR of 690. So even though it went up a little bit slower, I still had that one rep max strength in the tank, because I was fresh, I paced myself very well and this was my moment. So we loaded up the 700 pounds and we're about to see history. I'm about to pull 700 pounds for the first time ever. So without further ado, let's get right into it. \nNow, as I approach the bar, I'm taking in the moment, I'm trying to remember everything my coach is telling me, keeping my lower back as flat as possible, ripping the bar off the ground, but most importantly, not dying. Now at this point in time, everything goes silent. Even though I'm in a gym full of my best friends, everything goes silent and it's just me versus the barbell. So I take in one last deep breath and we go for it. \nI don't even remember these next couple of seconds happening, it just happened so fast. All I remember is my friends erupting and going crazy as I dropped the weight, and in that moment, I knew that I had achieved something special. It wasn't pretty, by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a good pull, and I knew from that point on that the floodgates were open and I was well on my way to pulling even more. So there you have it, guys. That was my 700-pound deadlift, something that I'm very proud of. I know I can do better, I know I can do more, but in that moment, it was everything that I could ask for and more. So I really hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, be sure to smash that like button and we'll catch you in the next one. Peace out."}

Now, let's talk about generating power and spin. A lot of players, they get that low-to-high swing, but then they kind of  'dab' at the ball, resulting in a weak shot.\n\nTip number four is to think about accelerating through the contact zone. Imagine you're trying to hit the ball into the back fence, not just over the net. Keep those wrists firm as you swing through, and let the racket head naturally lag behind a little bit. \n\nThis is going to help you generate what we call 'racket head speed'. The faster your racket head is moving, the more power and spin you're going to get on the ball. \n\nDon't be afraid to really let it rip!"}

For example, my horse is, I always say this, a little more difficult on the left rein. He doesn't bend as easily to the left. He's a little stiffer to the left. And the leg yield is a great exercise to make him supple. It also teaches the rider to separate their aids because when you're leg yielding, one leg has to be at the girth and the other one has to be behind the girth. So you're really asking the horse with one leg, you're pushing the horse over to the other rein and you're using your new outside rein to regulate the outside shoulder.

We want to maintain that vertical position as we're brushing up the back of the ball. \n\nNow, you might be thinking, \"My arm doesn't move straight up and down, it swings in an arc.\" And you're absolutely right. But the key is, we're talking about the racket face itself remaining vertical, not necessarily your arm.  Think about it like this: imagine a line going straight up from the ground towards the sky. As you swing through the ball, you want the racket face to travel along that line, maintaining its vertical orientation even as your arm swings in its natural arc.\n\nThis might feel a bit strange at first, especially if you're used to rolling your wrist or making other adjustments during your swing. But trust me, keeping that racket face vertical through the contact zone will do wonders for your control and consistency. You'll find that you hit the ball with more power and accuracy, and you'll be much less likely to spray the ball around the court."}

So, did 315 for 3 sets of 3 with a 5 second pause each time really happy with how these move as well. Like I said they definitely get the heart rate up they're very taxing, they're very stressful on your body but at this point being 2 weeks out from my meet I can't complain too much. Really just trying to stay focused and trying to stay on track with this and knowing that in the grand scheme of things it's really not that bad and it's going to pay off for me here in a couple of weeks. Moved on to some block pulls with 365 for 5 sets of 3 and I wasn't really pleased with how these moved. To be honest with you I don't know if my starting position was a little bit off or what but they just felt a lot heavier than what they should have but again at this point in the meet prep I'm not trying to like dissect things too much I'm just trying to kind of keep my head down, get the work in, listen to my body and make sure that I'm recovering adequately between sets and just doing my best at that point in time. So, we'll see how things move tomorrow but not too concerned about it. If I need to make any adjustments for next week I can do that but I'm pretty confident that things are gonna smooth themselves out here once we get closer to the meat and I get some rest. Then finished off with some sumo deadlifts, this is my dynamic effort movement for the day. Did 445 for a single really really pleased with how this moved. It flew off the floor, technique was good, really felt strong, really felt confident on this so this was actually an all-time PR for me. I had never pulled 445 from the floor sumo before so that was a nice little booster to kind of end out the day and let me know that you know even though I'm really tired and even though I'm really beat up that I am getting stronger and I am headed in the right direction. So overall really pleased with the day, pleased with how my body feels, pleased with where my head's at and yeah that's pretty much it for today.

I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to dive back in with you as we continue to explore the fundamentals of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. If you missed part one, be sure to check that out first \u2013 we covered some crucial groundwork there.  Today, we're focusing on a very important technique, especially for beginners finding themselves on the bottom \u2013 escaping side control.\n\n**(Video shows two people grappling on the mat. One is in side control, the other on the bottom.)**\n\n**Commentator:** Here we see our instructor demonstrating the importance of proper framing and hip movement.  Notice how he doesn't try to use brute strength against the person in top control.  Jiu-Jitsu is all about leverage and technique. \n\n**(The instructor begins to shrimp and create space)\n\n**Commentator:** The \"shrimping\" motion he's using is key.  This creates space and disrupts the base of the person on top.  You can see how he's framing against the shoulder and hip to prevent the top player from advancing their position. \n\n**(Instructor successfully creates enough space to escape side control)**\n\n**Commentator:** And there it is! A beautiful escape! Notice the smooth transition, utilizing those hip escapes and frames we discussed. The key takeaway here is patience and technique over strength.\n\n**(Video cuts to a different angle as the instructor explains the move)**\n\n**Commentator:**  The instructor is breaking down the finer points of the escape. Even experienced practitioners can learn from revisiting these fundamental movements. It's all about refining that technique! \n\n**(The video shows other students practicing the escape with their partners)**\n\n**Commentator:** Now, the students are getting hands-on experience. Remember, repetition is key in Jiu-Jitsu. The more you drill these movements, the more natural they will become when you need them. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, that's how we learn and improve! \n\n**(The video continues showing the class practicing with the instructor moving around giving pointers)**\n\n**Commentator:** The instructor is providing excellent individual feedback. This type of personalized attention is invaluable, especially in a beginner's class. \n\n**(The video comes to an end with students shaking hands and bowing)**\n\n**Commentator:** And that wraps up our second part!  We've learned a crucial escape from side control, a position you're bound to encounter often in BJJ. Remember, practice makes perfect, so get on the mats and start drilling!

Yes, they were fairly central on the face, but certainly nothing that would suggest I should be getting those kind of numbers.

And like I said, it looks like it's going to be a really, really good option off the tee as well, which kind of gives you that little bit of versatility, you know, take it on a par five, or maybe a tight par four, you just want to hit something that's not a driver, something that's gonna be a little bit more controllable, but still going to go a long way in the air.

But you know, again, I'm not trying to, you know, just make a drastic change. This week I just want to be consistent with how I felt last week, make sure I'm building upon it. And then next week, I'm going to go ahead and make another jump. It's funny because the weights didn't feel that heavy at all. They just felt really, really fast and that's kind of what I'm looking for. 255 for 8, that's a 5-pound PR for me. Yeah, I'll take it. You know what I mean? I'll take every PR I can get at this point, especially with how the rest of my training is going, it's just really, really easy. Uh, I'm recovered very well and that's kind of, like I said, kind of a testament to, uh, you know, setting my training maxes a little bit lower. I'm still working pretty hard, but I'm not getting blasted into oblivion. You know what I'm saying? I'm still able to come back and perform and recover really, really well. And I think that's very important in this sport because if you can't recover, you can't continue to get stronger. And that's basically it, it's just, you know, a marathon, not a sprint.

So he has to make that little adjustment. And that's okay, right? It's good to see a surfer of his caliber make those little mistakes here and there because it lets us know that, you know, we're going to make those mistakes as well. Even on really good days, you're going to have a wave where you don't quite catch it perfectly and you got to do a little adjustment like that.

So you have to drop like that, with the knee going down. So the impact go to the knee. And then force, to protect your leg. Otherwise, you end up breaking your leg or doing something silly with it.

I'd describe the emotions conveyed by the skaters and how they interpret the music through their movements. \n* **Technical Prowess:** I'd analyze the difficulty of their elements and how seamlessly they execute them, using specific skating terminology to explain their techniques.\n* **Chemistry and Partnership:** Ice dancing is all about connection. I'd remark on the skaters' chemistry, how well they move as one, and their trust in each other, especially during lifts and spins.\n\n**Overall:** \n\nMy commentary would aim to provide viewers with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the beauty, athleticism, and artistry of ice dancing, transforming the visual experience into a captivating narrative."}

Keep your upper body still and upright, with your weight back and your core engaged. Now, this will help you maintain traction on the rear wheel and prevent the front wheel from lifting. Imagine a straight line going through your hips and shoulders. By keeping them in line, you avoid rocking from side to side. This side-to-side motion wastes valuable energy, particularly when climbing, so maintaining an upright and still position is crucial. If you do find yourself leaning forward and putting too much weight on your hands, simply move your hands to the hoods to help centralize yourself again. And as we mentioned earlier, always try to conserve energy wherever you can, so avoid making any sudden jerks or movements with your bike.  Maintain a smooth and controlled style, allowing your legs to do the work. Now, when it comes to changing back into the saddle, try to do so just before the road levels out. This ensures you maintain your momentum and don't waste energy getting going again. So remember, practice makes perfect. By following these simple tips and techniques and putting in the time and effort, you'll soon be tackling climbs with confidence and efficiency."}

Imagine trying to balance on a wobbly surface with stiff legs \u2013 you'd topple over in an instant! \n\nBending your knees acts like a shock absorber, allowing you to adjust to the movements of the board and maintain your center of gravity.

Quick Sand Aa starting to make his move. Djibril DB on the inside. Quick Sand Aa challenging on the outside. Here comes A J Radson on the outside, trying to make a big run for it. And Quick Sand Aa takes the lead. It's Quick Sand Aa now. Pulling away with a furlong to go. It's Quick Sand Aa and Djibril DB and A J Radson in a battle for second. It's Quick Sand Aa by open lengths.  And Quick Sand Aa wins it. Djibril DB hangs on for second. Looks like A J Radson may get up for third.  Winning time, 1:55:02.

Hands above your shoulders and then basically slap your thighs so everybody can see that your hands are above your shoulders, not touching anything. Then you're going to grab the first mag, load the gun, drop the mag onto the magnet, grab the second mag and insert it into the gun. After the buzzer goes off, you are now free to engage your targets. This technique gives me a clear advantage in a situation where I have to pick up more than one mag and insert it into the gun. For the simple fact that the second mag is immediately available to be picked up and inserted. If I would have dropped the second mag on the table, this would take significantly more time. If you look at the setup that I have here, this is just one example that you may encounter. The distance between the two mags, the location of the mags and or the angle of the mags may differ significantly depending on the type of match and the range officer that designed the stage. You may even encounter a situation where you have three mags. You can follow the same technique, pick up the first mag, load the gun, drop it, grab the second mag, insert it into the gun, grab the third mag, insert it into the gun. If you have any questions about this specific technique, feel free to drop me a message below. Thank you for watching. I hope to see you at the range."}

Octo grabs are done by grabbing your ski like a Tony, but then poking your knees apart so that your legs create an octopus-like shape.

Because his board is actually touching the water here. The nose of his board's touching the water. And then he comes up, he gets a little bit more speed, but he's still kind of in that transition phase where his board is still touching. The white water and the face of the wave, if you can imagine there's a little bit of a difference there. He's still not fully planing, so he's still relying on gravity to generate his speed and get down the face of the wave. It's only until about here that his board releases from the face of the wave where you can really see he's on top of the water now. And this is where we would consider him a planing vessel. So it took a long time, right? If we go back to the beginning of this, he starts his drop, he's not planing, he's not planing, still not planing. Now he's starting to plane, and now he's planing. So that's a really important concept to understand about surfing is that you can actually still be going down the face of the wave but not be planing. You're still relying on gravity at that stage to generate your speed to get down to the bottom. And you can see how long that transition is from the top of this wave where he starts to the bottom, where it finally releases. So, again, he's tapping into gravity a lot more in this wave than Mason did on his wave."}

This is GoPro's new lens that gives you that super wide, almost fisheye look. It's designed to work with their Hero 9 and Hero 10 cameras. It gives you that real in your face kind of perspective, which I think could be pretty cool for mountain biking. The lens itself retails for about $100 Canadian. It's a little bit pricey, but I did find it on sale for about 30% off, so I figured why not pick it up, give it a shot, see what it looks like. Now, the lens is only compatible with the GoPro's \"Max lens mode\", which essentially crops in on the sensor a little bit to give you that hyper smooth stabilization. Now, you can use the lens without stabilization, but you're going to get really bad black bars around the outside of your image. So, I'm going to be testing the lens out in its \"Max lens mode\" with stabilization on. I'm going to be shooting everything in 2.7k at 60 frames per second, and we're going to compare that footage side by side to some shots that I got with the GoPro's standard lens to see what the difference is like. So if you guys are interested in seeing how the new GoPro Max lens mod performs out on the trails, stick around. Alright, let's get this thing mounted up to the bike and hit the trails.\n\n(Switch scene to the biker riding his bike in the woods)\n\nAlright, so we are here at Camp Fortune, first ride of the season, things are looking pretty good. It's a little bit dusty out here but hey, can't complain about hero dirt conditions on opening day. Trails are running fast, they're running good. Let's see what this GoPro's got.\n\n(Switch scene to a split-screen showing the difference between footage with and without the Max lens mod)\n\nAlright, so here's a little side-by-side comparison of that GoPro Max lens mod compared to the standard lens. You can see a pretty significant difference in that field of view. That Max lens mod just gives you so much more information on either side of the image. I also find that the distortion, the fisheye effect, is a lot more prominent in the center of the image with that Max lens mod. You're getting a lot of that curve right in the middle of the frame whereas I find the standard lens, that distortion, that curvature, is a little bit more evenly distributed throughout the image. That Max lens mod does have a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to framing your shots. You gotta be careful with your handlebars because they do tend to take up a lot of space in the image. But honestly, I don't hate it. It gives it a cool POV feel."}

This is another one of my favorite exercises, I like to incorporate this with the clients that I train, as well as part of my own routine. It's important with these to keep that front knee behind the toe, just like you would in a regular stationary lunge. You'll see a lot of people letting their knee go way past their toes, and that's not good, you want to avoid any kind of injuries there. Make sure you're engaging your core and keeping those abs nice and tight while you're doing these walking lunges. This will help with balance and stability as you're going through the motions. Now you're seeing me put the dumbbells down and pick up one dumbbell, and I'm about to do a single leg dumbbell lunge, or a Bulgarian split squat. So with these I like to use a bench. If you're at home, you can even use a chair or a couch. This exercise will really isolate the quads and glutes on that front leg, so you really feel the burn in these. Again, making sure that front knee stays behind that toe as you go through the motions."}

Backhand down the line from Simona Halep. Wow, she's so impressive. I think that's even better than the forehand down the line because the footwork has to be so precise and she's so light on her feet, Simona Halep. Beautiful balance, good rotation and the court position to recover was outstanding from Halep. Both players going toe to toe in this rally. Jankovic doing a good job of staying in the points.

And my swing, you can see it's low to high. Now, a lot of players, particularly beginners and intermediate players, their swing is pretty good. They do get down low enough on that waist-high ball, but as soon as you ask them to hit a ball that's a little bit higher than waist high, maybe chest high, they don't make the adjustment, okay? They'll still go 12 inches below the contact point, but since the contact point is now chest high, their racket's only dropping down to about waist high and then they're swinging up and the ball goes into the net. So what you have to remember is this: Always go 12 inches, 1 foot below the anticipated contact point. So if the ball's coming to me chest high, I gotta get the racket down to about waist high, okay, before I swing up. That's what I call the drop."}

Like I said, we're going to do both with a field point and a broadhead. Then we're going to go from there, maybe move out to 30 yards, see what it does, maybe even 40 yards.  We'll see how far out we want to go today. But I'm telling you what, this bow has been amazing so far. The feel, the functionality of it, everything about it has been awesome. So we'll see what happens here today.  Get some shots on it. Alright, so you see here, we got our Big Shot target.  We're going to go over the target here a little bit more in a minute.  But, first shot, 20 yards, field tip. Let's see what it does. (crossbow fires) Right in the kill zone, I'd say it's sighted in. 20 yards out of the box, ready to go. Alright, time to test the broadhead, 20 yards. See what this thing does. (crossbow fires)  Right there with it. You can't ask for much more than that. Okay, just to give you an idea here of what we're shooting. What we've got here is we've got the Big Shot target, okay? Big Shot's been around for a long time, excellent, excellent target. One of the things I like about this target is that you can shoot field tips and broadheads at it. It's a little pricey, but I'm telling you what, you get what you pay for.  I have yet to shoot this target out.  It's got tons of shots. I've had it for a couple years now, and it's still going strong. So, if you're looking for a great target, can't go wrong with Big Shot. They have different models, different sizes, but I'm telling you, this is definitely the way to go if you're a hardcore shooter, and want to practice a lot.  You got plenty of room to miss and plenty of room to make good shots. Like I said, we're at 20 yards here, field point and broadhead.  You can't ask for more than that. Dead on out of the box, ready to go. One of the things we're going to do is we're going to move out to 30 yards. And I'm going to show you a little bit about this Ballistic target holder. It's a really cool design. Easy to transport.  Easy to move around, because I like to move around in the woods, set up different scenarios."}

They're like a rocky, hard-packed surface in the main. There's a few really steep climbs. This bike is a bit of a rocket uphill with this suspension locked out. It just goes up these climbs like nothing else. It's incredible. And also on the descents, really confidence inspiring. You can brake really late. Suspension really helps on these descents. You can carry a lot more speed through the corners. Yeah, really, really enjoying this bike. So I've just come to a stop. Look at my legs. Covered in mud.

Well, he was absolutely flying. The black flagged car, though, had to pit, but the gap was coming down by about three seconds a lap, and Shedden was giving it his absolute all. Down the inside went Oliver Hart at Madgwick. Stunning stuff around the outside. This time, Shedden not prepared to give up and they went into the chicane absolutely side-by-side.

I think for this kind of terrain, where it's quite hilly, and you're going up and down all day long, you know what? I think I'd actually prefer to ride the rigid bike, just for the little bit of extra efficiency. Although, it's not going to be as much fun on the descents, but I'd save myself some energy over the course of the whole day. One thing's for sure, with a choice of a suspension fork or a rigid fork on a gravel bike, there's no right or wrong answer. It's just personal preference.

You can see how Pega's loading the plates on there. She's not afraid to lift heavy, which is good. I always tell people, \"Don't be afraid to lift heavy.\" Especially for women. A lot of women think that they're going to get bulky if they lift heavy, but you're not gonna get bulky unless you're on, you know, steroids or some type of supplement that's gonna help you bulk up. It's really, really hard for a woman to bulk up just naturally lifting heavy. So, don't be afraid to lift heavy, ladies."}

He makes it look so easy, but that time, 47.67, a testament to the speed and precision he brings to this event.  This is what dominance looks like, folks.

Alright, it looks like we've got a little head-to-head battle shaping up! A little rivalry, maybe? It's all love until it's about sending it for the win. Alright, let's see this next rider. Woah!

He's emphasizing keeping those shoulder blades off the floor and really focusing on engaging the abs to bring those elbows to his knees. This controlled movement is key, it's not about speed, it's about precision and really targeting those core muscles. \n\nNow he's transitioned to bent leg crunches.  Notice how he's keeping his feet off the ground, this increases the difficulty and really activates those lower abs. 10 reps of this controlled movement will definitely be felt! Remember, quality over quantity, maintain that form throughout."}

Here, he's gonna try to come up, he's gonna try to base out,  we drive our knee into his side, we shrimp out a little bit with our hips.  Good, now we have a perfect angle to come up on top.

This smooth transition will mean you won't lose momentum and your rhythm should stay constant. Make sure you don't leave it too late to change gear, though. If you're struggling to turn the pedals when you're out of the saddle, it's too late! Change down a gear or two before you get to this stage to make it easier for yourself. Practice shifting gears whilst out of the saddle, and you'll be able to maintain a steady rhythm on longer climbs."}
{"video_id": "7_bHCx_Rchs", "event_id": 8, "begin": 58.274, "end": 68.583, "pred": "Excellent! So, we've gone from a hollow back where the seat bones point forward, to a neutral spine with seat bones pointing down, and now a rounded back where the seat bones point backward. This is important because the direction of your seat bones influences your entire posture.  Notice how rounding the back makes the rider lose the line from shoulder to hip to heel.  She is also losing the connection with her lower leg. Keeping those seat bones pointing in the right direction is key to maintaining a secure and effective riding position."}

To win a comp, you know, by yourself and then to get beaten like I did last year on a time penalty and then come back this year and win on the same waterway just, I don't know, it's a redemption thing in your head.
