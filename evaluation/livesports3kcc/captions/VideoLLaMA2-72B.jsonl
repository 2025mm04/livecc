Lamb got a hand in there, and the try is scored by Tambui. You look at this. Well, he just read that like a book, didn't he? He had the outside speed, and he just had to find a good chase from Lamb. And yeah, the ball bounces, but this guy here has got the wheels, and you're not going to get him. Well, they did get one before, but this one ain't going to get caught back. Another penalty coming. Laumapi away for Barrett. Barrett goes wide and Hilsen's in. And the Hurricanes finally get one. He just gives himself a bit more time here. You can't quite get to him. Plus, he has to come in, and you ain't gonna stop Wess Wesson from there. Looking to maintain his 100% record, and he does that.

Do one out near the center line somewhere. Right, yes. That's better, that's better. Alright. At the end, he lost his balance. Otherwise, it was pretty good. And so on the diagonal, do three every four. Plus three. This is his rest period. All right. Come back down to the circle at A. That's good. Under your circle at A, and out by the center line, make kind of a working pirouette where you remind him how much he needs to think. All right. go ahead, as much as you're turning him with your hips, which you were, keep delivering the energy forward to the pole with your hips too. Move down to the middle circle and do one at the center line, same kind of thing. Keep your seat in the saddle, go to your fingertips, not your fists, That's pretty good. Good. Good. And out of it. Yeah, that was good. Now we have to make it smaller. And to make it smaller, try to take your outside leg not as far back. See if you'll turn anyway. Put the whip in the inside. Don't bend it. Whoa, whoa. You are such a hot dog. You mean I'm a wiener? No, not that. I'll be Coldworthville. All right, well that was good. Up a little, don't be in a hurry.

The focus is on getting the opponent to drop their hands, leaving them vulnerable to a left hook to the head. The boxer achieves this by strategically targeting the midsection with precise punches, forcing the opponent to bring their hands in. Once the opponent's hands are down, the boxer swiftly executes an overhand punch, taking advantage of the opening created. The technique emphasizes keeping the gloves parallel and touching inside to maximize accuracy and power. The boxer demonstrates the combination at different speeds, showcasing the importance of throwing punches rapidly until the opponent drops their hands. The power behind the left hook is generated through a combination of footwork and body weight transfer, resulting in a devastating blow. Overall, the video provides valuable insights into effective boxing techniques and strategies for exploiting an opponent's weaknesses."}

He takes off on his wave, and he takes one stroke and then the air drops into it. So that's something to really consider when you're trying to catch a wave. The interesting part about this one is that he has to do a little bit of an airdrop. So going back to watching for the angles of the waves, you can see that this wave, ignore this part because it's actually off screen over here in line with the wave over here is what we want to look for. You can see it's quite steep there, steepens up. Where he's at, it's pretty flat. And it's pretty flat in front, all the way in front. So this is a much smoother transitioning wave than Mason's wave. You can see it's very steep at the top, and then it mellows out at the bottom, right? So when we're looking at a wave like this, this is vastly different than Mason's wave, even where Mason was taking off on. John should tap into gravity a lot sooner, and that's why at this point where he takes his stroke, you can already see that he transitions to a little bit steeper. Let's say if we were to measure him here. Oops. Let me use this tool. We're measuring him here. That's flat. Times he finishes his stroke right there. Now you can look at the angle of the wave where he's at and you can see the difference there. He starts his pop up here. And he finishes his pop up. there and you can see actually the steepness of the wave is there even though his board is flat. He had to do that because he's in a very steep section of the wave. He did not catch most of the momentum. This is a great example of him just waiting for gravity to take him to that 45 degree angle before he drops down and into the wave."}

Another technique involves switching to a whizzer grip and turning the knee down while framing off the opponent's head. The ultimate goal is to slip the leg out, kick back, and switch to a front headlock while keeping the opponent's elbow open and pulling them down with a sprawl.

Once you have the hang of it, try to do the zero spin in one fluid motion. Remember to keep your arms straight out in front of you and look forward at the end of the tramp. With some practice, you'll be able to nail the zero spin on skis in no time!"}

Now, let's move on to the actual technique. When you approach the table, make sure to grab the magazines with your strong hand, and hold them together in a stack. Then, using your support hand, pick up the gun and load the first magazine into it. Engage the targets as needed, and then repeat the process until all magazines are loaded and targets are engaged.

Before I explain and show you the actual technique, I want to touch on your competition belt. Regardless of whether you have a production type setup or you have an open setup as I have here, I strongly recommend that you invest in one or more magnets to be able to increase the time for you to actually attach a mag to your belt. Instead of a situation where you do not have any magnets, and you will have to. physically insert the magazine into a magazine pouch. This obviously takes much more time than attaching it to a magnet. On my particular belt, I have a magnet really in the center of my competition belt. This serves twofold. One, it's a clear indication that my belt is in the middle and always at the same location when I put it on.

The first scene shows the Somerset team starting well against Lancashire on day one, with Triscothic and Bartlett both hitting centuries. Lancashire needed some vital early wickets to stay in contention, and it was a positive start for Tom Abel, the Somerset skipper, securing his half-century off 136 balls. However, his partner Gregory didn't last too long in the morning and was dismissed for 10 after his miscue resulted in a catch off the bowling of Bailey. Some more runs were added to the scoreboard by Abel and Overton, but despite some positive batting, Overton was then out, caught by Anderson off Parkinson. In the next over, Abel looked to close in on his century but was dismissed just one run short, Joe Mennie finding the breakthrough. And just two balls later, new man Leitch was dismissed for a duck bowled by Parkinson caught by Villas. Despite a low-order resistance from Gronevold and van Meekeren, the final wicket fell just two overs later, Parkinson picking up his third of the day as he dismissed van Meekeren for six. The second scene shows Lancashire won without loss when they resumed in the afternoon. Davies and Jennings were the openers for Lanx and they started well, finding several boundaries. It wasn't until the 11th over that the first wicket went down, Davis out for 23, Groeneveld with the scalp. Captain Livingston didn't last long; he fell victim to Jack Leach LBW for six. Jennings, however, continued to push on, collecting successive boundaries, and he soon brought up his first 50 for his new club, that 50 coming off 141 balls. Newman Villas also looked in good nick, hitting two sensational sixes off successive deliveries. Both he and Jennings took the match to tea without loss, the score 103-2 at the break, Jennings and Villers helping to steady things for Lancashire after Somerset's good start, and the pair look to build on their already valuable 55 going into the final session."}

Despite losing an early wicket, they were able to build a solid partnership between Chopper and England's Wesley, with both players scoring quickly. However, Wesley fell to his international teammate Wokes, and Essex suffered a setback when Chopra was dismissed just two runs short of a century. Laurence scored quickly after the break, and with Chopra also into the 90s, Essex moved past 200 and into the lead. Foster and Harmer were the new men at the crease and both settled in well with Foster in particular taking the game to the Warwickshire attack. Essex's lead continued to grow into the evening session, much in thanks to Foster's 50. And when Harmer fell LBW to Wokes for 24, that didn't change the batting mindset. Quick runs were the order of the day, and Wagner added nine before departing. Overall, it was another superb performance from Essex, who look on the brink of securing the title."}

He emphasizes the importance of swinging low to high to ensure net clearance and prevent hitting the ball in the net. He also stresses the need to get the racket at least one foot or 12 inches below the contact point to achieve the necessary lift. Additionally, he advises players to keep the racket face closed at the low point of the backswing to prevent hitting the ball long beyond the baseline. When making contact with the ball, Coach Tom recommends hitting the equator of the ball and keeping the racket vertical for at least a half a foot to a foot after contact before letting the wrist and forearm relax on the finish. By focusing on these key points during practice, players can improve their forehand technique and become more effective on the court."}

In this video, we'll be sharing some tips and tricks to help you improve your game. We'll be focusing on the fundamentals of bowling, including proper footwork, release, and targeting. So whether you're a beginner or an experienced bowler looking to refine your skills, this video is for you. Let's get started!\nFirst, let's talk about footwork. Proper footwork is essential for a consistent and accurate delivery. When approaching the foul line, take a few steps forward with your dominant foot, then step forward with your non-dominant foot. This will help you maintain balance and control throughout your delivery.\nNext, let's discuss release. The key to a good release is a smooth and controlled motion. Keep your arm straight and your wrist relaxed as you swing the ball forward. Aim to release the ball with a consistent speed and rotation, and try to keep your hand in the same position throughout the release.\nFinally, let's talk about targeting. Targeting is all about finding the right spot on the lane to aim for. Most bowlers aim for the arrows on the lane, but it's important to experiment and find what works best for you. Try different angles and speeds until you find a consistent target that works for you.\nThat's it for our tips on lane play for bowlers. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep working on your footwork, release, and targeting, and you'll see improvement in no time. Thanks for watching!"}

He has made a name for himself as a player and coaching the men's team. Yeah, for sure, because I mentioned it in the pregame, I was looking at the lineups of different teams. Not much, not much changes. A few additions, like for Cherry, it's Adiba Bikar as the coach. Saya Adorador? To serve here formally from UE. And one of the best liberos, unable to get a good pass there. Again then, Lazo Revilla. And Vogue is a really good player. I mean, she started, starting for Cherry. And she's playing good. That's right. Together with Tina Wong, a lot of, huge fan base. Underhand set for Napore. Harris, caught up. Hits it outside though. Back to Fahad. A little push. Valentino with the up. Good save. Chance ball here for Che. Coordination play. Layug with the point. Toe injury that will not allow her to play for the next few games. And despite this, the crossovers encourage her saying. She's wearing a boot. Safety boot. Not a winner. And obviously disappointing she will not play. As Taporan tips it in. Nabor. They go to Adorador. Wong to Ogunsarya with a tip. What a perfect pass from Descheng. Paved the way for that play, Ogonchayme gets the point. Jen Bufaner posts a lot of bonding moments with these teams in the town and also in the provinces on vacation. As Tapuron will score. Doing it all for charity, which we expected. Well, that's obviously part of that. I mean, aside from the fact that she's very skilled as Bea de Leon with the cup. Oh, good save. Valentino with the attack. They're gonna run with the tip and good save again by Paez. There's a tip by Navor and she stops that mini run of Choco Mucho. Issa Molde, that's dug up by Angeles. Back row, layup. Right on the line, yes. Molde, trying to go down the line. Did she clip it? Yes, she did. Solid to Lady Black by Cheritigo. What coverage. What a dip there by Dino Wong. Sorry Miss Q there. Ortiz, a former Photon Tornado. That's now Cheritigo obviously. Oh, Valentino with a kill. We gotta credit the set. The blockers were slow to close. Nabor underhand set to Paat. What a cut shot. Daqueron, excellent low defense by the Flying Titans. Molde, cross court, yes! Good pass. Daqueron amid that, Paat with a tip, yes! Angeles with the pass, Nabor to Layug. Valentino again, yes! Paat! Four points of Capt. Valentino lead the way for the Flying Titans as they lead by two. Here's the opening set. There's a block by Ogunsana. And for Ogunsana, that was a process, right? I mean, you saw him get better and better as each game progressed. That's true. Passing has been a problem, that first ball for Terry Tigo. Paat, back row attack, off-speed hit. Dino Wong sets it up, they go to Captain Dino. There's miscommunication here for Chevy Eagle, they're not talking. There's Cheng, blocked, excellent play defensively by Joy Tacoron at the net. Oh, tipped by Ogunsanya, doesn't go through the net. Come to think about it when you said fracture goes like ouch. Yeah. And she fractured it in a two-knock game just a few days ago.

The demonstrator starts by forming a loop with the rope coming from the climber, creating a U shape. They then place their left index finger in the U of the loop. Next, they lead the rope around the back and over the fingertips, resulting in a finished half-mast knot held in their hand. The finger serves as a placeholder for the carabiner. The demonstrator leads the carabiner along where the finger is and connects it with the rope loop of their belt. It is crucial that the brake cable runs along the healthy shank of the carabiner to prevent accidental opening due to rope friction. If the half-mast knot is tied correctly, it should be visible whether the knot is turning or not."}

When you're in close proximity with your opponent, you can use the stick to control their movements and create opportunities for strikes. Let's demonstrate how to do that.\n\nIn the clinch position, you can use the stick to push against your opponent's body or limbs, creating leverage and controlling their movements. You can also use the stick to strike them while maintaining the clinch. It's important to maintain a strong grip on the stick and keep it close to your body to prevent your opponent from disarming you.\n\nNow, let's practice integrating the clinch work into our flow drill. We'll start with the same striking combinations, but this time we'll add a clinch at the end. Remember to maintain control of the stick and use it to your advantage in the clinch. Let's go ahead and try that together.\n\nGreat job, guys. Now let's take it one step further and practice defending against an opponent who is armed with a stick. In a real-life scenario, you may encounter someone who is trying to attack you with a stick. It's important to know how to defend yourself and disarm your opponent.\n\nWhen defending against an opponent with a stick, it's crucial to stay calm and assess the situation. Look for openings and vulnerabilities in their technique. You can use your own stick to block or deflect their attacks, or you can use your hands to grab and control their stick.\n\nOnce you have successfully defended against their attacks, you can then attempt to disarm them. This can be done by using your stick to knock their stick out of their hand or by using your hands to grab and twist their stick, causing them to lose their grip.\n\nRemember, disarming an opponent should always be a last resort. It's important to prioritize your own safety and escape if possible. But knowing how to defend yourself and disarm an opponent with a stick can give you an advantage in a self-defense situation.\n\nLet's practice defending against an opponent with a stick. We'll simulate an attack and then work on disarming them. Remember to stay calm, assess the situation, and use your stick or hands to defend and disarm. Let's go ahead and try that together.\n\nGreat job, guys. That concludes our training session on Krav Maga stick fighting. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep working on your striking combinations, clinch work, and disarming techniques. Stay safe and train hard."}

The second tip is to keep the racket face closed at the low point of the backswing to prevent the ball from going long. The third tip is to hit the equator of the ball and keep the racket vertical for at least a half a foot to a foot after contact before letting the wrist and forearm relax.

Once the opponent moves their arm, O'Connell quickly transitions to the arm drag and pulls his opponent down to the mat.

This is what we wanted on the running down to San Jose. If you missed out on most of our coverage today, you have missed a great stage. You can go back and watch it on demand. But the story of the day, it was a group of four that went away early. Nydum, Martins, Lemois, and Koza. They got a group of five to six minutes. They were pulled back on the climb of Mount Hamilton. and the leading group formed over the top of there. It was George Hincapie who attacked on the descent as they went down towards the final Cat 1 climb of the day on the Sierra Road. Over the top of that one it was these two riders here, Robert Hesink of the Rabobank team, and Levi Leipheimer of the Astana team that went clear. They pushed the lead out just over a minute and as they come in towards the final kilometers now, the lead coming down under the minute within about 40 seconds. The composition of the second group includes riders such as Fabian Cancellara of CSC, the world time trial champion who's done a quite incredible ride to make it over Mount Hamilton and the Sierra Road and be up here and be in with a fight at the end. The Slipstream team, David Miller, Dave Zabriskie, Thomas Peterson and Christian van der Velde, Gustav Larsen also in there for CSC, Bernard Cole, Maurizio Ardilla, Victor Hugo Pena, Sil Dreyas and Van der Waal are from Quick-Step. There's some serious firepower in this group. And Brian, if it continues like this, these two riders are going to be dragged in before the finish. Well, if they keep up this, yes, they will be dragged in before the finish. But you can just see some of the efforts on Levi Lightpimer's face. He's absolutely showing the effort now, putting his head down. And his sink has been on the limit for the last 10 kilometers. These two riders in front and leaving the team cars in. That kind of plays into the hands a little bit of the chasing group, doesn't it? Leaving the cars in so late, because you've got something to spy. They need to get the team cars out of there now, because it foreshortens the distance. But tell me, David Miller just does a turn there, strings it all out. You can see, Victor, you've got pain. You get thrown about at the back in the whiplash. Victor Hugo absolutely swinging it on the back of this group, but great to see the rock racing team finally speaking with their legs and their bike racing rather than everything else that they've done.

The instructor, Coach Tom Avery, provides three tips for improving your forehand. The first tip is to swing low to high and get the racket at least one foot or 12 inches below the contact point to ensure safe net clearance. The second tip is to keep the racket face closed at the low point of the backswing to prevent the ball from going long. The third tip is to hit the equator of the ball and keep the racket vertical for at least a half a foot to a foot after contact before letting the wrist and forearm relax on the finish. The instructor emphasizes the importance of focusing on one or two points while practicing and demonstrates the proper technique for each tip."}

Extends Kershaw's scoreless inning streak to 40 consecutive innings. Still scoreless in the bottom of the fourth, Odryce Mary Despanier pitching for San Diego. Yasiel Puig lines one back off Despanier's leg into left field. Puig ends up at second with a double. Scary moment, though, as everyone would come out and check on Despanier. He would be OK, despite taking the shot off the inside of the left leg. Later in the inning, Puig on third with two outs. Scott Van Slyke comes through with a base hit to right field. Puig scores. The Dodgers go up 1 to nothing. Kershaw, he was still cruising in this one. In the sixth, he strikes out Despanier swinging, and just a formality with the throw down to first. Then, down goes Kristadorfia for the second out of the inning. But, as Kershaw looks for yet another scoreless inning, Chase Headley has other ideas. A deep shot to left center, and it leaves the yard. A solo shot for Headley, his seventh of the year, that ties the game at one. Kershaw's scoreless inning streak comes to an end at 41 innings, a standing ovation from the Dodger faithful in LA. Next batter up with two outs, Carlos Quinton goes down swinging. Kershaw with yet another standing ovation as he heads back to the dugout. Bottom of the sixth with the game tied at one, Adrian Gonzalez at the plate with a man on third and one down and Gonzalez comes through. with a sacrifice fly to center. Hanley Ramirez tags and scores. The Dodgers take a 2-1 lead. That one run would be all Kershaw would need in the eighth. Kristen Orphea strikes out swinging. Again, the formality of the throw down to first, then in the ninth, a little payback on Headley. He goes down swinging on the big hook with two down in the ninth. Kershaw looking for the complete game facing Renee Rivera. Well, he finishes with a flourish. That's 11 strikeouts for Clayton Kershaw. Another absolutely incredible performance.

Lamb got a hand in there, and the try is scored by Tambui. You look at this. Well, he just read that like a book, didn't he? He had the outside speed, and he just had to find a good chase from Lamb. And yeah, the ball bounces, but this guy here has got the wheels, and you're not going to get him. Well, they did get one before, but this one ain't going to get caught back. Another penalty coming. Laumapi away for Barrett. Barrett goes wide and Hilsen's in. And the Hurricanes finally get one. He just gives himself a bit more time here. You can't quite get to him.

Oh, Moore's in a bit of space. Wouldn't want to try and be the tackler. Oh, he's done him. Oh, it's Laumapi. Nani Laumapi it is. They've seen space here, haven't they? And look at this. Well, if that goes in his hands, he's gone. But what I like about this, he uses his footwork and his speed. As it uses power to run over the smaller man, makes the outside break. That is beautiful to watch. And away they go then at the end of the first 40 minutes of the game. And here at Sky Stadium in Wellington, it is 17 each. So over the ball is Noshe. And he fires it back for fullback Farsi that's hooked away in field for Geordie Barrett. He immediately releases up to Lamb, and off goes Ben Lamb! Striding away, Ben Lamb! And the Hurricanes score early in the second half. Lovely pass there, Geordie. Just the outside break on Paul the Fend. That's a get out of my way, and man, that is awesome. Swings it away for Evans. Garden Basham with the cross kick. And Lamb's got it. Now, can he go all the way Ben Lamb? I reckon he can, or maybe. Yeah, I reckon he did. Garden Basham, he finds it off the boot. And that there, well, it goes into Lamb's hand. You take those 50-50 calls, but a runner like his, he just backs himself. Fussy is no slouch, and Lamb backs himself on the outside. Coles throws."}

It started with Pace, it started with Umar Gul. Alistair Cooke nicked off outside off stump. He won't be happy with this, will he? It's wide. Good catch. He's having a very good match. It's good behind the stumps. The truck played all round a straight delivery. It looked straight. Hawkeye suggesting it was sneaking down the leg side, but he didn't review it. It just looked out at the time. There you go. Very controversial dismissal. In the old days, you would have never been given out for that because the umpire knows this technology, knows there's another man you can go to. 2.2 millimetres in favour of Pakistan. Peterson looked good, but he'd gone. Well, yet again. When you're out of luck, this is what happens. It hits the end of the keeper's gloves, bops onto the bails. He hasn't got back. Didn't pick it. Morgan didn't pick that. A quicker delivery. Reviewed, and rightly so. That was quick. Hit him for pace, sitting back, plumb LB. Almost a replay. That time it hit the stumps. Matt Pryor was definitely worried about getting his bat in the way. And it just turned enough to go past the bat. He's held up. You can see the disappointment. That was all yesterday in the shadows. Next wicket to fall was today. Night watchman Jimmy Anderson didn't survive the first over. Driving out the rough, always dangerous. Encouraging Monty Panesar. That's turned a lot out the rough."}

This is what we wanted on the running down to San Jose. If you missed out on most of our coverage today, you have missed a great stage. You can go back and watch it on demand. But the story of the day, it was a group of four that went away early. Nydum, Martins, Lemois, and Koza. They got a group of five to six minutes. They were pulled back on the climb of Mount Hamilton. and the leading group formed over the top of there. It was George Hincapie who attacked on the descent as they went down towards the final Cat 1 climb of the day on the Sierra Road. Over the top of that one it was these two riders here, Robert Hesink of the Rabobank team, and Levi Leipheimer of the Astana team that went clear. They pushed the lead out just over a minute and as they come in towards the final kilometres now, the lead coming down under the minute within about 40 seconds. The composition of the second group includes riders such as Fabian Cancellara of CSC, the world time trial champion who's done a quite incredible ride to make it over Mount Hamilton and the Sierra Road and be up here and be in with a fight at the end. The Slipstream team, David Miller, Dave Zabriskie, Thomas Peterson and Christian van der Velde, Gustav Larsen also in there for CSC, Bernard Cole, Maurizio Ardilla, Victor Hugo Pena, Sil Dreyas and Van der Waal are from Quick-Step. There's some serious firepower in this group. And Brian, if it continues like this, these two riders are going to be dragged in before the finish. Well, if they keep up this, yes, they will be dragged in before the finish. But you can just see some of the efforts on Levi Lightpimer's face."}

So let's get started.\n\nSo the first thing we're going to talk about is flow drills. Flow drills are a great way to warm up for any kind of stick fighting or stick training that you're going to do. And what it does is it gets your body moving in different directions, it gets your heart rate up, and it also helps with your coordination and your timing.\n\nThe next thing we're going to talk about is stick clinches. Stick clinches are when you're in close proximity to your opponent and you're using the stick to control them, to strike them, or to set up throws or takedowns. And there's a lot of different ways that you can use the stick in a clinch, so we're going to go over some of those today.\n\nAnd finally, we're going to talk about disarms. Disarms are obviously very important when it comes to stick fighting because if you can take away your opponent's weapon, then you have a much better chance of winning the fight. So we're going to go over some basic disarms and some more advanced disarms as well.\n\nSo that's what we're going to cover in this video.

In this particular session, which is week 5, day 3 of his training log, he focuses on dynamic effort lower body exercises. He performs speed squats, pause squats, speed deadlifts, and snatch grip deadlifts off blocks. Despite feeling like he's getting the hang of his shoes, Brandon notes that his speed still looks good compared to last week's overall work. He also mentions that his squats are looking much better and that he hit a rep PR of 325 for 13 in pause squats, an improvement from last week's 305 for 15. However, he admits that he set his training max too low and will continue to adjust as needed.

So right here, I still haven't quite made it into the pack, but about 400 meters later, right here, just before we make the left turn, head back towards the village.

You can do this grab leading or trailing, but it's a little easier leading. To get there, start with a tony grab and reach across your body with the opposite hand to grab the ski you're not grabbing with the tony. This grab is a little more difficult because you have to be flexible enough to reach across your body and grab the ski. But once you get it down, it looks really cool and adds some style to your skiing. Remember to practice on a trampoline or in a soft landing area before trying it on the slopes. Keep experimenting with different grabs and tweaks to find your own unique style."}

In the background, there are other people playing tennis on adjacent courts.\n\nThe young man starts by bouncing the ball on the ground a few times before tossing it up in the air to serve. However, instead of hitting the ball straight, he intentionally hits it with a lot of spin, causing it to swerve unpredictably in the air. This is known as the \"Drunken\" serve, which can be difficult for opponents to anticipate and return.\n\nAfter serving, the young man watches the ball fly over the net and land in the opposite court. He then walks towards the net to retrieve the ball, ready to start another point.\n\nOverall, this video showcases a unique serving technique that can add variety and unpredictability to a player's game."}

The process involves forming a loop with the rope coming from the climber, creating a U shape, and placing your left index finger in the U of the loop. Then, you lead the rope around the back and over the fingertips, resulting in a finished half-mast throw in your hand. The finger serves as a placeholder for the carabiner, which is then led along where the finger was and connected to the rope loop of your belt. This technique provides a secure and reliable way to protect your climbing partner during a climb."}

Ben Manowar is standing over him, looking for the finish. The referee is keeping a close eye on the situation, making sure Pitbull is safe. It looks like Pitbull is going to try to defend himself, but he's still struggling to get up. Ben Manowar is being cautious, not wanting to rush in and get caught with a counterattack. Pitbull finally gets back to his feet, but he's still unsteady. The referee is giving him every opportunity to continue, but it's clear that he's not at 100%. Ben Manowar is circling around him, looking for an opening. Pitbull throws a wild punch, but it's easily dodged by Manowar. It looks like the end is near for Pitbull. And there it is! Ben Manowar lands a devastating blow, knocking Pitbull down for good. The referee jumps in to stop the fight, and we have a winner! Ben Manowar by knockout!"}

This is an important point to consider when surfing, as the angle of the wave can affect how you approach it. In this case, John John has to do a little bit of an airdrop to catch the wave. It's also worth noting that the size of the wave at takeoff is approximately the same as Mason's wave in the previous video, which was moving around 14 to 18 miles per hour into the beach. By comparing and contrasting these two waves, we can gain a better understanding of how to catch a wave easily."}

However, Hameed and Vilas steadied the ship with a solid partnership. Hameed looked in good form, scoring 43 runs before being caught by Leitch off the bowling of van Meekeren. Lancashire continued to build their innings with contributions from various batsmen, including Vilas who scored a half-century. However, they were unable to match Somerset's first-innings total and eventually declared on 321-9, setting Somerset a target of 322 to win. In response, Somerset got off to a strong start with openers Trescothick and Bartlett putting on a century partnership. However, Lancashire fought back with some disciplined bowling, picking up regular wickets to restrict Somerset's progress. Despite some resistance from the lower order, Somerset were eventually bowled out for 287, giving Lancashire a hard-fought victory by 34 runs."}

To force you to hit it, did he though? No, you can't. And shortly converts the par putt. Here we go. Xander Shuffling now starting off in back 9. Super conservative play here. Gary with an iron off the tee. Certainly don't want to put that left bunker in play, but that's well back. It looks like he's totally under control though. Daddy is. Well, it got that little shelf. He's gotta get the ball up on top of the head. A good look at it. 148 to that 151 total. Pitching wedge comes up just at the base. Another super sticky one up the Hill Gary. Just so hard to hit it hard enough. And that is headed at the right bunker. May need to get fortunate. Plop. Or landed in it. Bob Rossberg, of course, made on course announcing. Famous and everyone loved him. Oh, another power lip. Leave the 11th with a bogey. Well, that is headed left and pretty far left. He gotta he gotta break there. Really didn't have a choice but to lay up. This is from a pitching wedge 147. No breeze at all. You'll be brave when looking at the back edge of that green Dottie. Hit it. Moving in, yeah. As we go to the 13th. OK, we like it. Everybody likes it might be the most important fairway to hit on this side. Gary without a doubt again. Daddy, we've had. So we're always looking for birdies here. Well, and you would think this may be your 4th. That's just a pitching wedge left. All importance of these two pots. Gotta hit it, gotta hit it, Xander. Yeah. They shouldn't be allowed to hit a driver on a hole under 400. Come on, we need another rule in the game ago. Yeah, just what we need and that one's left. Angle is just miserable. Center of the green just 20 feet right of the hole. Dotty, I guess be good for him. That's exactly what he tried. If it stays up on top. She's on top of the leaderboard. Here's the action of 14. And send a shelf lead who you just mentioned. That is a little bit further left, but not much. Now it's starting to cut. I like that idea. Wow, great shot the one. Can tie the lead if he holds it can reward that great shot. Wisely waited for Munoz ball to come to rest before he hit this tee shot important tee shot. That is perfect. He avoided Swan Lake on the right. Trying to get in a tie right here. Bingo, yes. Both guys with enough firepower. I think Ian with two really good shots will threaten that that putting surface. I agree, Dottie, and they've got to have a crack at it. We've got three tied at 13. Jamie Love Market 12. Well, drive was 331. Just 85 yards left. Lovely. That is left and going further left. High and soft. Somewhat predictable. I like that better than long in the rough over the back. Well, that's true. Oh, it's just coming back down the slope. Didn't quite get over. Well hold. That's been solid. Tied for the lead."}

He emphasizes the importance of using your foot and ankle movements to tip the ski onto its edge, rather than relying on knee movements. By pushing the ankle towards the outside of the boot, the ski goes onto the edge, and the knee follows. Harald also mentions that once you start with this movement, the ski will want to turn, but it's important not to put too much weight on the ski or press it down. Instead, you should lighten the ski and leave a little pressure on the tip to help it make the curve. Additionally, he explains that when you make this movement, the other ski needs to do the same thing. By lightening one foot and switching your balance over to the other leg, you can create a parallel turn with both skis on edge. The key is to stay balanced over your skis and not push them away."}

The rotating punch at the end is also a great finishing move. Your demonstration was clear and easy to follow along with. Keep up the great work!"}

They are both from Milan and are being coached and choreographed by Mateo Zanni. This is their first Junior Grand Prix season, and this is their second event of the year. They achieved a personal best score of 54.09 in their previous event in Austria. Sara Campanini and Francesco Riva were ranked fifth in the dance category in Linz. The judges noted that they had very soft knees, especially during the first part of the dance. However, they were praised for their intense and aggressive interpretation of the tango. During the routine, they performed some midline steps which were rated as level three, the highest level achieved so far in the competition. The couple displayed good speed and flow across the ice with nice deep edges."}

However, it's technically bad for him to have as a habit. So if he was ever to throw the jab, and I came back at him, he really should clear the way.

Now, we know when I kick back here, if you're familiar with this, there can't be any space here, there can't be any space that way for the ball and chain submission to be effective.

Chance ball here for Che. Coordination play. Layug with the point. Toe injury that will not allow her to play for the next few games. And despite this, the crossovers encourage her saying. She's wearing a boot. Safety boot. Not a winner. And obviously disappointing she will not play. As Taporan tips it in. Nabor. They go to Adorador. Wong to Ogunsarya with a tip.

Jen Bufaner posts a lot of bonding moments with these teams in the town and also in the provinces on vacation. As Tapuron will score. Doing it all for charity, which we expected.

It's tied at one, and we've got a ballgame.\n\nIn the bottom of the fourth inning, the Rams are gonna take the lead again. Senior Kelsey Oshiro is gonna hit a two-run homerun to left field, and it's 3-1 Rams. But the Lancers are not gonna give up.

The technique involves a defensive wrestler responding to an opponent's single leg takedown attempt. As the opponent isolates one of the defensive wrestler's legs, the defensive wrestler quickly reacts by crawling their hands towards the isolated leg, aiming to position their hips over the opponent's shoulder. The defensive wrestler then scisscors their feet, with the free leg going low and the isolated leg going high. This maneuver creates a challenging situation for the opponent, as the defensive wrestler looks to grab the opponent's arm and flex their hamstring to maintain control. The move is designed to counter the opponent's takedown attempt and potentially score points in freestyle wrestling."}

Top five now, it's Houston rookie Dallas Keuchel facing Miley with runners on the corners, and Miley lays down the successful safety squeeze that will bring in Gerardo Parra from third for the first run of the game, and Arizona with a one-nothing lead. That sets the stage for the next D-backs batter, Chris Young. Young, a high fly ball, deep left field, and this ball is off the wall. Young on his way to second, and he is in with a double as Nieves scores to make it two to nothing. Bottom six now, it is a two to one game.

This is what we wanted on the running down to San Jose. If you missed out on most of our coverage today, you have missed a great stage. You can go back and watch it on demand. But the story of the day, it was a group of four that went away early. Nydum, Martins, Lemois, and Koza. They got a group of five to six minutes. They were pulled back on the climb of Mount Hamilton. and the leading group formed over the top of there. It was George Hincapie who attacked on the descent as they went down towards the final Cat 1 climb of the day on the Sierra Road. Over the top of that one it was these two riders here, Robert Hesink of the Rabobank team, and Levi Leipheimer of the Astana team that went clear. They pushed the lead out just over a minute and as they come in towards the final kilometers now, the lead coming down under the minute within about 40 seconds. The composition of the second group includes riders such as Fabian Cancellara of CSC, the world time trial champion who's done a quite incredible ride to make it over Mount Hamilton and the Sierra Road and be up here and be in with a fight at the end. The Slipstream team, David Miller, Dave Zabriskie, Thomas Peterson and Christian van der Velde, Gustav Larsen also in there for CSC, Bernard Cole, Maurizio Ardilla, Victor Hugo Pena, Sil Dreyas and Van der Waal are from Quick-Step. There's some serious firepower in this group. And Brian, if it continues like this, these two riders are going to be dragged in before the finish. Well, if they keep up this, yes, they will be dragged in before the finish. But you can just see some of the efforts on Levi Lightpimer's face. He's absolutely showing the effort now, putting his head down. And his sink has been on the limit for the last 10 kilometers. These two riders in front and leaving the team cars in. That kind of plays into the hands a little bit of the chasing group, doesn't it? Leaving the cars in so late, because you've got something to spy. They need to get the team cars out of there now, because it foreshortens the distance. But tell me, David Miller just does a turn there, strings it all out. You can see, Victor, you've got pain. You get thrown about at the back in the whiplash. Victor Hugo absolutely swinging it on the back of this group, but great to see the rock racing team finally speaking with their legs and their bike racing rather than everything else that they've done. But a great performance by Victor Hugo Pe\u00f1a to make this group in the green and black of rock racing on the back of this group. Back up to the front, Robert Hessing and Levi Leipheimer. Can they hold on to the finish? The sun is shining for them today, the rain of yesterday has gone, and a little bit more California-type weather for them today. Yeah, this is certainly Californian, and it's the Californians bringing them into San Jose. And when they said the song, Show Me the Way to San Jose, it's certainly been the Levi Leipheimer that's shown them today. But the cars have gone behind, and this gap is down to 15, 20 seconds."}

Very confident and very strong. And in fact, she has one of the highest start values in this competition. I believe it's at a 10 point hole if she hits everything. You know, this gymnastic club that she's from, the Parkettes, have just turned out a number of great athletes who have been fantastic on the balance beam. But this routine is not just good by the code standards. It's also very interesting, very different and truly difficult gymnastics like what you're going to see right here. This is a flip flop full on the beam. Super difficult. And you know, to give you an example, that type of move we will be seeing a lot of back in December when the Romanians brought their young team, five out of the six young girls were doing that type of element on the beam.

So that's something to really consider when you're looking at taking off on a wave like this. The interesting part about this one is that he has to do a little bit of an airdrop. So going back to watching for the angles of the waves, you can see that this wave, ignore this part because it's actually off screen over here in line with the wave over here is what we want to look for. You can see it's quite steep there, steepens up. Where he's at, it's pretty flat. and it's pretty flat in front, all the way in front. So this is a much smoother transitioning wave than Mason's wave. You can see it's very steep at the top, and then it mellows out at the bottom, right? So when we're looking at a wave like this, this is vastly different than Mason's wave, even where Mason was taking off on.

The first method shown is the half-mast throw, where a loop is formed with the rope coming from the climber, and the left index finger is placed in the U of the loop. The rope is then led around the back and over the fingertips, resulting in a finished half-mast throw. The finger serves as a placeholder for the carabiner, which is then connected to the rope loop on the belt. It is important to ensure that the brake cable runs along the healthy shank of the carabiner to prevent accidental opening due to rope friction. The video also shows a second method called the Mickey Mouse method, where two loops are formed with the cable running in front and back, resembling Mickey Mouse ears. These loops are then folded together to create the half-mast throw. The carabiner is attached to the rope loop in front of the belt, and it is crucial to check if the knot turns and the brake cable runs on the healthy thigh of the carabiner. The video concludes by demonstrating how to secure with the HMS, showing two possible brake positions for both descent and ascent. The brake hand can be held up above the carabiner or down below, and the guide hand lets the rope run into the carabiner. The video emphasizes the importance of releasing the brake hand properly to avoid tangling the rope when releasing the climber."}

The coach is giving him instructions on how to properly handle and shoot the shotgun. He starts by having the man start in the ready position and then brings the shotgun up and fires a shot when given the command. The coach emphasizes the importance of being consistent with the cheek weld onto the stock of the shotgun and not pushing the shotgun or being afraid of the recoil. They also practice breaking the shot and immediately working the action as if they were going to have to fire a second shot. The coach also simulates a scenario where the shotgun had an empty chamber, a loaded magazine tube, and the safety was off and the shotgun was not cocked.

The instructor starts by introducing his friend Zachary and then explains that the only prerequisite for learning a gainer is knowing how to do a backflip. He emphasizes the importance of having a good back foot and tuck, and demonstrates what a bad backflip looks like. The first progression involves doing a normal backflip and landing in the same spot, then gradually trying to land further away from the starting point. The instructor also notes that if someone can do a backflip or gainer and land in the right spot, they will be able to make it off the ledge."}

So would you say that's like a basic move in Jiu-Jitsu then? That throw that we've just done, probably to do properly, would take two years. We break his posture here, maybe knee to the face, or you could even maybe take his hand here, break his elbow here. Then I'm going to come in very deep here with my hips.

I'm actually going under and between his legs. The key thing is I want to keep this grip as high as I can. My other foot comes down, and I'm going to hip in. I've got his other sleeve here. In this position, I'm already under the guy, so I'm going to pull him forward and elevate him with my foot. From here, I'm just going to switch my hips and come up on top. All right, let's do that again."}

The person in the video performs a shifty by counter-rotating their upper and lower body while in the air. They start by hopping on the trampoline without skis to get a feel for the movement. Then, they place their hands straight in front of them and look forward at the end of the trampoline. For a left side shifty, they rotate their hips and feet to the left while keeping their arms and shoulders to the right. They practice this movement a few times in a row to make it feel easy. Next, they try a right side shifty using the same steps but in the opposite direction. They also experiment with different styles by pulling in their legs or kicking out their feet like a donkey kick. Finally, they demonstrate a zero spin, which involves taking off and landing switch without any rotation. They break down the shifty into two bounces and practice it until they feel comfortable. The video concludes with the person trying the full shifty movement in one bounce, pushing it past 90 degrees for extra style. Overall, the video provides a detailed guide on how to perform shifty and zero spin on skis, with step-by-step instructions and demonstrations."}

She falls behind in the count, but manages to strike out the batter with a well-placed pitch. It's impressive to see her composure and focus under pressure.\n\nSpeaking of pressure, let's take a look at this play at home plate. The Maryland batter hits a sharp grounder to the shortstop, who makes a quick throw to the catcher. The catcher tags the runner just in time to get the out. That was a crucial play to end the inning and keep Michigan's lead intact.\n\nNow we're seeing some offensive fireworks from Michigan. This batter hits a towering fly ball that just clears the fence for a home run. It's her third homer of the season and it gives Michigan a comfortable lead.\n\nFinally, we have this defensive gem from the Michigan outfielder. The Maryland batter hits a long fly ball to left field, but the outfielder tracks it down perfectly and makes the catch on the warning track. That was a great play to rob Maryland of extra bases and keep Michigan's momentum going.\n\nOverall, it was a dominant performance by Michigan in all facets of the game. Their pitching, defense, and offense were all clicking on this night. It's no wonder they are the top team in the Big Ten."}

Make sure you have a good grip on the dumbbell and keep your back straight throughout the movement. You want to make sure you're not swinging the weight up and down, but rather focusing on contracting your bicep muscles as you lift the weight. And remember, it's all about form and control, not how much weight you're lifting. So take it slow and steady, and really feel the burn in your biceps."}

The liver shot is delivered using the left hand to hit the opponent's liver, located under the floating ribs on the right side of their body. This punch can cause the opponent to lose their breath and struggle for about 10 seconds. On the other hand, the spleen shot is thrown using the right hand and targets the spleen, located under the floating rib on the left side of the body. This punch can cause internal damage and result in blood in the urine for a few days. To execute these shots, the boxer needs to step offline slightly, dip their weight down onto their lead leg, and push off it while punching upwards into the body. The principle is similar to shoveling dirt, where the boxer dips down and shovels upwards into the body. It's important to keep the other hand up for balance when throwing the spleen shot."}

Lamb got a hand in there, and the try is scored by Tambui. You look at this. Well, he just read that like a book, didn't he? He had the outside speed, and he just had to find a good chase from Lamb. And yeah, the ball bounces, but this guy here has got the wheels, and you're not going to get him. Well, they did get one before, but this one ain't going to get caught back. Another penalty coming. Laumapi away for Barrett. Barrett goes wide and Hilsen's in. And the Hurricanes finally get one. He just gives himself a bit more time here. You can't quite get to him.

After mastering the basic mute, Japan, and safety grab, it's time to explore more creative tweaks and pokes that can add flair to your skiing repertoire. The beauty of freestyle skiing is that there's room for personal expression, and different people may come up with their own unique names for these tweaked grabs.\n\nPracticing on trampolines is an excellent way to refine your technique, as you can get hundreds of jumps in a single day. This allows you to experiment with various grabs and find the perfect tweak that suits your style. Keep in mind that leading and trailing grabs have distinct rotations, which can significantly impact the feel and appearance of the trick. So, once you've nailed a grab, try it both leading and trailing to discover new possibilities.\n\nFlexibility is a valuable asset when attempting more advanced and tweaked-out grabs. For instance, taking a mute grab and switching hands on it can result in an overhook, toney, or wall mute. These variations can help you stand out on the slopes and showcase your creativity and skill. Keep practicing and exploring new grabs to elevate your skiing game!"}

Very confident and very strong. And in fact, she has one of the highest start values in this competition. I believe it's at a 10 point hole if she hits everything.

This is part three of our turtle position series. So, let's get started.\n\nSo, what we're going to do here is we're going to start in the turtle position, which means that our opponent has their hands on the ground and their knees tucked under their body. From here, we're going to come over the top with our arm and we're going to try to get it under their chin. We're going to use our other arm to control their head and pull it down towards our body.\n\nOnce we have control of their head, we're going to bring our leg over their head and we're going to try to get it behind their neck. This is where the anaconda choke comes into play. We're going to squeeze our legs together and we're going to use our arms to control their body and keep them from escaping.\n\nThis move can be really effective if you have good control of your opponent's head and if you can get your leg behind their neck. It's important to remember to keep your body tight and to use your hips to generate power when you're squeezing the choke.\n\nThat's it for this video. We hope you found it helpful.

Climbing out of the saddle is ideal for getting over steep sections or relieving back muscles. The video also highlights the importance of good bike fit and correct saddle height to ride efficiently and improve power. By lowering the saddle height slightly, one can avoid feeling overly stretched at the bottom of the pedal stroke.

Very confident and very strong. And in fact, she has one of the highest start values in this competition. I believe it's at a 10 point hole if she hits everything. You know, this gymnastic club that she's from, the Parkettes, have just turned out a number of great athletes who have been fantastic on the balance beam. But this routine is not just good by the code standards. It's also very interesting, very different and truly difficult gymnastics like what you're going to see right here. This is a flip flop full on the beam. Super difficult. And you know, to give you an example, that type of move we will be seeing a lot of back in December when the Romanians brought their young team, five out of the six young girls were doing that type of element on the beam. So you know that that's the trend. Little bit tentative here and there. Kind of strange to see in the stands after the competition practice rounds the other day. Crystal Uslak signing autographs at age 14. Hasn't done much beyond the two junior championships.

{"video_id": "vU_zQJrAVfk", "event_id": 4, "begin": 47.409, "end": 62.28, "pred": "In this video, you will learn the correct skating posture. For good posture when skating, remember these three steps. The position of your chest, bending your knees, and using your arms. Firstly, the position of your chest. Stand upright with your two feet perpendicular to your board. Your shoulders should be in line with your feet. Keep your back straight and look straight ahead of you. To find your balance on your skateboard, shift your weight from right to left and forward and back to find the most comfortable position for you. To move your feet, for example to turn, the movement should come from the shoulders.\n\nSecondly, bend your knees. Bend your knees slightly to lower your center of gravity. This will help you maintain balance and control while skating. Keep your knees slightly bent throughout your ride, but avoid locking them as this can cause discomfort and reduce your ability to maneuver.\n\nLastly, use your arms. Extend your arms out to the sides to help with balance and stability. You can also use your arms to generate momentum by pushing off the ground or swinging them in the direction you want to go. Remember to keep your elbows slightly bent and your hands relaxed to avoid strain.\n\nBy following these three steps - the position of your chest, bending your knees, and using your arms - you can improve your skating posture and enjoy a smoother, more controlled ride."}

I'll get changed, stick my number on the handlebars, and we'll hit the trails. So I rode the Grizzle when it launched last year up in Scotland, had a great time at that event and really enjoyed the bike. They had the Grail for a few years with the hover handlebar, a very fast gravel race bike, but the Grizzle is a better gravel bike. Regular handlebar, nice short stem, nice geometry, works on the road, off-road, spacious wide tyres, lots of accessory mounts for bags and bottles. just what you want from a Grail bike really."}

Before I explain and show you the actual technique, I want to touch on your competition belt. Regardless of whether you have a production type setup or you have an open setup as I have here, I strongly recommend that you invest in one or more magnets to be able to increase the time for you to actually attach a mag to your belt. Instead of a situation where you do not have any magnets, and you will have to. physically insert the magazine into a magazine pouch. This obviously takes much more time than attaching it to a magnet. On my particular belt, I have a magnet really in the center of my competition belt. This serves twofold. One, it's a clear indication that my belt is in the middle and always at the same location when I put it on. I use this for my first magazine that I usually start with, especially when it's an empty unloaded start. This is the first magazine I actually pick to load up in the gun. The second magnet I have here is a magnet I use for specifically the technique that I will explain to you later on. And then I have a third magnet. which I usually use when I finish my stage. The arrow tells me to unload and show clear. When I pick up the mag out of the gun, this is the location where I actually put my mag. With a production gun, the magnet would be located here. I referred to a previous how-to video that I made discussing the basic techniques and options you have for a basic table start situation. This is a slight variation of it, because instead of having one magazine that I have to load into the gun, I now have two magazines.

It's a really cool and unique grab that looks great in the air. To do it, you need to have good balance and control over your body. As you jump, bring your knees up towards your chest and reach down with your hand to grab the ski. Make sure to keep your body tight and compact while you're in the air. The octo grab can be done on both skis, so try it out and see which one feels more comfortable for you. Remember to practice this grab on a trampoline or soft landing surface before trying it on snow. With enough practice, you'll be able to nail this grab and add some style to your skiing."}

Stand upright with your two feet perpendicular to your board. Your shoulders should be in line with your feet. Keep your back straight and look straight ahead of you. To find your balance on your skateboard, shift your weight from right to left and forward and back to find the most comfortable position for you. To move your feet, for example to turn, the movement should come from the shoulders. Secondly, bending your knees. Stand on your board with your feet at right angles to the deck.

Before I explain and show you the actual technique, I want to touch on your competition belt. Regardless of whether you have a production type setup or you have an open setup as I have here, I strongly recommend that you invest in one or more magnets to be able to increase the time for you to actually attach a mag to your belt.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a proper belt. The belt should be tight enough so that it doesn't move around during the shooting process. You can use a regular belt, but a competition belt is recommended because it provides better support and stability.\n\nNext, you need to position yourself next to the table with the magazines. Make sure that you are standing in a comfortable position and that you have a clear view of the magazines. You can also use a chair or stool if you prefer to sit down while loading your gun.\n\nNow, let's talk about the actual technique. The key is to pick up multiple magazines at once. This will save you time and allow you to reload your gun faster. To do this, you need to use both hands. With your dominant hand, pick up the magazine closest to you and hold it in your palm. With your other hand, pick up the second magazine and hold it between your thumb and index finger.\n\nOnce you have both magazines in your hands, you need to load your gun. To do this, insert the magazine into the magazine well of your gun and push it up until it clicks into place. Then, pull the slide back to chamber a round.\n\nFinally, you need to engage your targets. Take aim and fire your shots. Remember to keep your sights aligned and your trigger press smooth.\n\nThat's it! By following these steps, you can pick up multiple magazines from a table, load your gun, and engage targets quickly and efficiently. Don't forget to practice this technique regularly to improve your speed and accuracy."}

He explains that the success of this move depends on the strength of his arms and the positioning of his body. The coach then proceeds to show how to execute the move by reaching across and moving the arm over, grabbing the opponent's tricep, and stepping his knee into the middle to prevent the opponent from getting their arm back. He emphasizes the importance of keeping the arm over and maintaining control throughout the chokehold.\n\nThe coach also mentions an alternative option if the opponent does not tap out during the arm over guillotine chokehold. In such a scenario, he advises kicking the opponent over with a hook and transitioning to an anaconda choke. This alternative chokehold involves reaching up, adjusting the position of the head, and securing a tight grip around the opponent's neck.\n\nThroughout the demonstration, the coach provides detailed instructions and encourages the viewers to practice both the arm over guillotine chokehold and the anaconda choke. He emphasizes the importance of proper technique and body positioning to ensure the effectiveness of these moves in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) grappling scenarios.\n\nOverall, the video aims to educate viewers about the arm over guillotine chokehold and its transition to the anaconda choke, providing them with valuable techniques to enhance their BJJ skills."}

This is a weight that I can handle for multiple reps, but it's still challenging enough to provide a good workout.

However, as I mentioned earlier, I've been working on a narrower grip to improve my tricep strength. This variation requires more stability and control, which can be challenging, but it's important for overall development. Let's get started with the first set."}

This occurs after he has completed his pop-up and is fully standing on his surfboard. At this stage, he is able to maintain his balance and control as he rides the wave. The transition from paddling to planing is seamless, allowing him to smoothly navigate the steep section of the wave. It's worth noting that John's ability to wait for gravity to take over and gradually transition to planing is a skill that requires experience and finesse. By allowing gravity to work in his favor, he is able to conserve energy and maintain control throughout the ride."}

The Flying Titans are playing with confidence and momentum, making it difficult for their opponents to keep up. The crowd is cheering them on, adding to the excitement of the game.

The bike is being reviewed at the Grind Duro gravel event in Wales, which is a popular gravel event with locations around the world. The reviewer rode the Grizzle when it launched last year and enjoyed the bike. The bike has a regular handlebar, nice short stem, nice geometry, spacious wide tires, and lots of accessory mounts for bags and bottles. It is a good choice for most people who want a bike that works on the road and off-road. There is a choice of a rigid carbon fork or a suspension fork. The event has several time stages of about three to five kilometers in length, either climbing, descending, on fire road, or on single track in the woods. The weather is very damp today."}

Do one out near the center line somewhere. Right, yes. That's better, that's better. Alright. At the end, he lost his balance. Otherwise, it was pretty good. And so on the diagonal, do three every four. Plus three. This is his rest period. All right. Come back down to the circle at A. That's good. Under your circle at A, and out by the center line, make kind of a working pirouette where you remind him how much he needs to think. All right. go ahead, as much as you're turning him with your hips, which you were, keep delivering the energy forward to the pole with your hips too. Move down to the middle circle and do one at the center line, same kind of thing. Keep your seat in the saddle, go to your fingertips, not your fists, That's pretty good. Good. Good. And out of it. Yeah, that was good. Now we have to make it smaller. And to make it smaller, try to take your outside leg not as far back. See if you'll turn anyway. Put the whip in the inside. Don't bend it. Whoa, whoa. You are such a hot dog. You mean I'm a wiener? No, not that. I'll be Coldworthville. All right, well that was good. Up a little, don't be in a hurry.

Don't chase him, take it easy. Yeah, inner edge. That's right, because there you actually threw him too much with your left leg. About a quarter of the way through it. Or at least he overreacted that way. You know what I mean? Yeah, let me try that again. Yeah, do one on the way on the diagonal. Don't be in a hurry. Make him take more steps. Lean back. Look up.

This is a variation that I've been using for a while now, and it's something that I really like because it helps to develop strength out of the bottom, which is where you need it most when you're doing a bench press. It also helps to develop lockout strength, which is important for getting the bar back up after you've paused it on your chest.\n\nIn this particular set, I'm using 230 pounds for five reps, and I'm doing five sets of this. So, it's a pretty heavy weight for me, but I'm able to get through it okay. As you can see, I'm wearing a belt, which is something that I always do when I'm doing paused bench presses, simply because it helps to stabilize my core and keep everything tight.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is meant to emphasize tricep strength development, so I'm really focusing on squeezing my triceps at the top of each rep and making sure that I'm getting a good stretch in my pecs at the bottom. I'm also trying to keep my elbows tucked in as much as possible, which is something that I struggle with sometimes.\n\nOverall, I think this is a pretty solid set. I'm able to get through all five reps without too much trouble, and I feel like I'm getting a good pump in my triceps and chest. Of course, there's always room for improvement, so I'll be looking to add more weight to this exercise in the coming weeks.\n\nThat's all for now, folks.

By doing so, the defender can create a scissor-like motion with their legs, trapping the attacker's head between their thighs. This move is known as the \"Popup Leg Scissor\" and is commonly used in wrestling to counter single leg takedowns.

The bike has a RockShox suspension fork and is made of carbon fiber, making it an excellent choice for the Grinduro gravel event. The man changes into his cycling gear and heads out to ride the trails. He comments on how good the bike looks and how well it rides. The bike has a rigid carbon fork or a suspension fork, and the man chooses the latter for the extra comfort it provides when riding on rocky descents. The bike also has a short stem and wide handlebar for extra control, and fat bar tape that is grippy and cushy. The frame can accommodate up to 50mm wide tires, but the man opts for 45mm tires which are great on the road and fast, dry gravel. The Schwalbe G1 bike tire is generally a good tire, but the man finds that tire choice is critical for gravel bikes, depending on the terrain and conditions. During the race, the man stops for lunch and enjoys some food and coffee before continuing in the afternoon.

You don't want to be in too high a gear, because then you'll be struggling to turn the pedals over, and you'll be wasting energy. You also don't want to be in too low a gear, because then you'll be spinning your legs too fast, and you won't be able to generate enough power. So find the gear that's just right for you, and stick with it.\n\nThe second thing to remember is that you need to use your body weight to your advantage. When you're climbing out of the saddle, you can use your upper body to help push the pedals down. This is especially useful when you're going up a steep hill, because you can really lean into it and generate some serious power. But when you're climbing in the saddle, you need to use your lower body to do the work. This means that you need to keep your upper body still, and focus on driving the pedals with your legs.\n\nThe third thing to remember is that you need to be smooth and controlled. Don't thrash around on the bike, because that will just waste energy and make you tired. Instead, try to be as smooth and controlled as possible. This means keeping your movements small and precise, and not making any sudden or jerky movements.\n\nAnd finally, the fourth thing to remember is that you need to practice. Climbing is one of the most difficult parts of cycling, and it takes time and effort to get good at it. So don't be discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Keep practicing, and you'll get there eventually."}
