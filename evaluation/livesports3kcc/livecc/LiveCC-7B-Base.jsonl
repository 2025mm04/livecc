Well you know you can see how much better Yorkville has gotten since last season. They're really strong at the net. We've got to do a better job blocking their hitters. You know, we have to be more aggressive on offense. We didn't hit the ball very well today. So those are the things that we need to work on. But overall, I mean, I'm happy with us.

That's pretty much what you want for accuracy. Now, if you were shooting steel at ten yards or less, you'd probably want something like this. Maybe even tighter. But if you're going to be doing any sort of competition or anything like that, it's definitely gonna need to be tighter than that.

These two are from sixteen point two grains of powder. And then these two are from seventy grains of powder. So, yeah, definitely happy with those results. The only thing I don't like about this gun is that every once in a while when I'm loading up the magazine, the first round will kind of nose-dive. It's happened before. You know, maybe once every five times maybe twice out of ten times. Not too big of an issue. Just gotta reach in there and push it down. But other than that, really happy with the accuracy. Really happy with how well they grouped. Really impressed with CFE pistol. I think I might try some other powders next time but I do have a lot more of this stuff on hand.

So we'll start with my partner on top of me. I'm in side control. He's got good posture. He's not letting me get my hooks in or anything. What do you guys think is going to happen here if I try to get my hook in? It's probably not gonna work out very well for me. It's just gonna be really hard for me to get that hook in. Right? And it might even hurt him. Right? So what am i going to have to do differently in order to make this work? What can I do differently? Well one thing that I could do is I could use the space between us. If he's sitting upright and I've got some space between him and his hips, I can use that space to put pressure down onto his hip. If I put pressure down onto his hip, he's gonna want to sit back down into the mat. When he sits back down into the mat, now I've got more room to move around. Now I can come under here and grab his leg. And once I've grabbed his leg, I can pull it towards me. As soon as it comes towards me, I can lock my legs together. Once I've locked my legs together, I can bring this knee across his face. As soon as I bring this knee across his face, now I can slide my hook underneath his armpit. From here, all I need to do is push off of my hand and lift up on his head. When I lift up on his head, I can slide my foot through underneath his arm. From there, I can step over his body and come right into mount. Let's take a look at what happens again. We're on our knees. We're in side control. My partner's got good posture. He's not allowing me to get my hooks in. All I need to do is create some space by putting pressure onto his hip. Once I've created that space, all I need to do is reach under grab his leg, pull it towards me, lock my legs together, bring my knee across his face, slide my hook through, lift up on his head, step over top of his body, and end up in mount.

First things first, I don't think this is a replacement for my current 3 wood. I mean, I really do like the M2, but I think it's designed more for that golfer who wants to play a fairway wood off the tee. For me, if I wanted something that performed as a 3 wood, I'd stick with the current one. If I wanted something that performed as a driver, I'd use this. But guys, I do love the fact that it's so forgiving. It's such an easy golf club to hit. And I can see why some people would prefer this over their normal 3 wood.

So you can mount your GoPro right onto the back of your hand while you're riding. So if you don't want to wear a chesty or a helmet cam, these will give you an alternative perspective when you're writing. They're pretty cool. Let me know how they go. And let me know if there's anything else that you'd like to see in terms of camera angles or perspectives. But anyways, enough talking, let's get out here and ride some trails! Alright guys, so first up is Lesser Evil. This is one of the more popular beginner trails at Camp Fortune. It's not too long, but it does have quite a bit of elevation change. And as you can tell from the name, it's got some technical features along the way. The trail starts off with this little rock garden here. You gotta watch your speed because if you hit it too fast, you could easily get thrown over the bars. Then after that, you drop down into what used to be called the Gully. Now it's called the Canyon. It's basically just a big rock slide. There was actually quite a bit of water down here last year, which made for a very slippery and sketchy descent. But now that all the leaves are gone, there isn't any water left to collect in the bottom of the canyon. So it should be pretty easy to descend through here without having to worry about slipping off the rocks. After the canyon, you cross over a small bridge into another section with lots of rocks. Then you drop down into another gully where there's a couple more drops. These aren't huge, but they do require a little bit of commitment. If you're not comfortable dropping these, then you can always choose to walk around them. Once you make it past those two drops, you come across a set of rollers before finishing", "event_id": 4}
{"video_id": "UAsffNLXyPk", "video_start": 395.621, "video_end": 515.4, "pred": "I think it's important to note that the Garmin LiveScope is not an exact science. It does show you fish, but sometimes it shows fish that aren't there or sometimes doesn't show fish that are there. So, don't rely solely on the Garmin LiveScope to find your fish. But if you do see something on a LiveScope, give it a shot. And you'll probably be surprised how many times you actually catch a fish after seeing it on a LiveScope.   The other thing about fishing the Pummerstone Passage is that it's very shallow. There's very little water depth and the current runs fast. So, make sure you use good quality line and use braided line if possible. Because you will lose a lot of gear down here. You need to keep track of your lines because they tend to tangle around each other quite easily. If you lose one rod tip, chances are you'll lose more than just one rod tip because everything gets tangled up.  Here's another example of how the Garmin LiveScope works. We're looking at the pylons underneath the bridge and you can clearly see the brim sitting on top of each pylon. Now, we didn't catch every single one of them, but we did catch enough to fill our bags. Scott Sandilands came fifth with five bream weighing two point eight kilos. Scott was fishing his local waterways around Bribie Island using soft plastics and live bait. He said: \"My strategy was to try and target those areas which had the best structure and cover.\" \"Also try and avoid any snags as much as possible.\"  Peter Cashman's win is a testament to his knowledge of the Caloundra area.

It's just kind of like holding a baseball bat at the end. So you always want to hold it right around where the handle starts. That way you've got good control over it.

But either way, it should be fun. Let's do this. Go, Tigers!  Princeton in Lane two. Drexel in Lane three. The Dragons of Drexel University are off to a strong start here at the 500 meter mark. They lead by about two seats over the Tigers. The dragons will look to hold that lead as they head down towards the Thousand Mark.   At the Thousand Mark, the dragons still hold their advantage. They have extended their lead over the Tigers. Now leading by four seats. The Tigers will need to make up ground if they want to catch up before the finish line.  As we approach the halfway point, the dragon's lead has grown even larger. They now lead by six seats over the Tigers. This is looking like it could be a big victory for the Dragons. But the Tigers aren't giving up yet. They're fighting hard to try and close that gap between themselves and the Dragons.   With just under half of the race left, the Dragons continue to extend their lead. Now leading by eight seats over the Tigers. The Tigers are doing everything they can to stay within striking distance but they don't seem to be able to keep pace with the Dragons.   As we near the end of the race, the Dragons maintain their advantage. They're holding steady at nine seats ahead of the Tigers. The Tigers are trying desperately to close that gap but it doesn't seem like there's much more they can do.   With less than one minute remaining, the Dragons are pulling away from the Tigers. They're extending their lead even further. Right now, they're pulling away by ten seats. It looks like this might be a big victory for the Dragons.

So these were two sets of eight. And then we moved on to dumbbell flies. These were also a rep max exercise. We went for four sets of ten. Again, I'm not using any kind of heavy weights here. Just enough to keep tension and stress on the chest. Really focusing on keeping the elbows high throughout the entire range of motion. Keeping them high at the bottom, so they're not dropping down towards my sides. That's something that you should avoid when doing flyes. You want to focus on getting the most range of motion possible without letting the elbows drop down too far. Because again, that puts unnecessary stress on the shoulder joint. But overall, this was an excellent workout.", "event_id": 10}

It was just one of those sets where things weren't going their way. But they kept fighting. They stayed with it. Ledoux had her best match of the season with 17 kills. She also had a career-high six blocks. Saxton had her best game as well. She finished with 24 kills. The only problem is, they couldn't get anything done against the Beavers. We'll see if they can turn around and win tomorrow night when they play Stanford. Yeah, that will be interesting. I think they have to find a way to keep the ball in play longer than three or four touches. That's not gonna happen against Stanford. Stanford has one of the best defenses in the country. If they don't find a way to keep the ball alive, then they won't be able to score. Well, we'll see about that. This is a team that's been playing well lately. They lost two matches last week, but they beat UC Irvine three straight sets before coming out tonight. So maybe they can pull an upset. Maybe they can pull an upset.

The CQB is a very good gun for this kind of playstyle because it has a lot of power in such a small package. It also allows me to be mobile while still having enough power to take out those long range players. The only downside is that this gun has no hop-up, but that doesn't really matter when you have a red dot sight. This gun can easily take down any player at close or medium range.  After getting one kill, I decide to move back into the middle of the field and try to find more players. As soon as I get around the corner, I see two blue players in front of me. One of them turns his head towards me which lets me know he sees me too. So I quickly move behind cover and wait for him to turn away again. Once he does, I quickly pop out and fire two shots through the window. Unfortunately, both shots hit the wall before they could hit their target. So now I need to figure out what to do next. I don't want to stay here because there's a chance these guys will come back and shoot me if I stand where I am. But I also don't want to go back towards the spawn area where all the other players are. So instead, I decide to run over to the church and flank them from the side.  When I reach the church, I notice that there's no one inside. But then I hear someone coming from behind me. So I quickly turn around and look over my shoulder. And sure enough, there's a blue player standing just outside of the door. He sees me immediately so I quickly draw my pistol and open fire. He takes three shots before falling dead. Now I've got three kills under my belt but I think I should probably switch guns since I'm running low on ammo. So I grab my Raptor 4 SMG and head back to the middle of the field.   Upon reaching the center, I spot a blue player hiding behind the spool. I quickly peek around the corner and open fire. Unfortunately, he manages to dodge all four bullets and shoot me twice. Luckily, I managed to return fire and take him out before he could finish me off.", "event_id": 3}

Yeah, sometimes just brushing helps so much. Because if you're not sure about something, you don't know how hard it will be when you actually try it. If you brush first though, you can see exactly how hard it is. You can see all the moves, and you know whether they're possible or not. Sometimes you might think oh, I could do that, but when you brush it, you realize oh no, I cannot do that. Or vice versa: sometimes you think this is too easy, but after brushing you find out that it's actually quite difficult. So it's important to brush before trying anything new.

He's a junior high schooler and he just recently hit his first ever 900-pound squat in competition. He did this at the USPA Junior Nationals and it was his first meet of the year. Caleb is also an absolute monster on deadlift day where he managed to hit a 600-pound PR for a total of over 800 pounds. Now I'm sure some people might say that this isn't really all that impressive because there have been other kids who've done better than this before him but I think there's two things you need to take into account when looking at his performance. First off, we should look at how much weight he actually weighed during the meet. He came out on stage weighing about 250 pounds which means that if he had made all three lifts with no misses, he would have broken the record for the youngest person to ever squat over 900 pounds. The second thing to consider is how much time has passed since he started training power lifting. Caleb hasn't even been training for three years yet so he still has plenty more room to grow as an athlete. So what does this mean? Well, if he continues to train hard and stay healthy, then he could easily be able to break into the top ten or even the top five by the time he hits his prime. And even though he's already pretty big now, he'll probably get bigger as well. So what do you guys think? Do you think Caleb Smith has potential to become one of the best power lifters in the world someday? Let me know your thoughts down below in the comments section.

But other than that, they seem to be working pretty well. We haven't had any issues with them yet. I think we'll probably end up switching over to the 12 balls just because they hold a lot more paint. But overall, it seems to be working pretty well. It's not too hard to use. The only issue I found was when you first load up the mag, sometimes they get stuck inside of the adapter. And once you get past that point, then everything else seems to feed through really nicely. Yeah, so far, I'd say this is a great product. If you're looking for something new to try or maybe even if you already know how to run magfed, but maybe you want to try something different, this would be a great option.  One thing I did notice was that the trigger pull seemed to be a little bit longer than normal. Maybe that's just me getting used to running magfed again after a while since I haven't done it in quite some time. But yeah, overall, I'd say this is a great product. Hey guys, Hobbs from PBN. Just finished playing some games with the Tippmann Magfit Adapter. Overall, I'd say it worked pretty well. There were no malfunctions or anything like that.

I can use this as an exercise to teach him to be soft on the reins. To ask him to stay soft on the rain. To teach him to stay balanced throughout the circle. To keep his balance through his whole body. To make sure he doesn't get too heavy behind. It's very easy when you're doing circles to get your horse heavy behind. And then you lose all control.

Alright guys, we've had a couple games now, and uh, it was pretty cool. We played some Capture The Flag, which is always fun. And then we also played this game called snakeslide which is basically Capture The Flag but instead of carrying your flag back across the field, you actually have to snake slide back through the enemy's territory to bring it home. So basically you can only carry your flag in one hand while you're running backwards through the enemy's territory trying to avoid being shot at by them. And once you reach the other side then you slide down on all fours until you hit home plate where you put your flag down and then run forward again. It's kind of hard to describe, but if you watch these clips from the gameplay footage, you'll understand what I mean. And it's really cool how much strategy goes into that game. Like for example, there were times where one team would try to snake slide as far as they could before they'd even start bringing their flag home, whereas other teams would try to keep their flag protected by bringing it home slowly so that they wouldn't get killed halfway through the snake slide. So anyway, after those two games, we decided to switch things up and play something else. And uh, we ended up playing something called Team Deathmatch. Which is basically just regular deathmatch except instead of killing people individually, you kill them in groups of three. So when someone gets killed, everyone has 10 seconds to run over to them and finish them off before they respawn. If anyone kills someone within those 10 seconds, then everyone dies. But anyway, after about an hour or so of playing Team Deathmatch, we ran out of time, so we went ahead and packed everything up and headed over to the milp store to pick up our prizes. And here's a little clip from the last round of Team Deathmatch with me and Callum. And yeah, we won both rounds in Team Deathmatch, but unfortunately my camera died right afterwards, so there wasn't any footage left. But anyways, thanks for watching guys.

It was made popular by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Frank Zane. And they used them to develop their quads. Now there's different ways you can set these up. I prefer using a step-up box. What I've done is I've taken two dumbbells and placed them side-by-side. That gives me an elevated surface that I can use as a platform. Now if you don't have access to dumbbells, you could just use a chair. The key with this exercise is controlling the movement. So you want to make sure you control it on the way down and then explode up. Another thing you want to focus on when you're doing this exercise is finding something in the wall to look at. Pushing your chest out. This will allow your shoulders to stay back and prevent you from dropping your shoulders forward during the movement. If you drop your shoulders forward, you're gonna put more stress on your neck and potentially hurt yourself. So push your chest out, find something on the wall to look at, and control the movement. That's how you get maximum results using this exercise. Give it a shot, let us know what you think. Biggie's tip of the day: Bulgarians split squats.", "event_id": 4}

How did you feel when you found yourself in contention during the final round? Well, I'm always nervous around the cut-off line anyway.

And yeah, I ended up getting first place with 90 points, so I was stoked on that.  Yeah, boy!   It felt really good to win this contest. I mean, you can see from my reaction after the run, I was pumped. And I was even more pumped once I found out how high I scored. So I guess for me personally, winning contests isn't always about the money or anything. Sometimes it's just about feeling good in your own head. Feeling confident and feeling strong. That's what winning does for me.   The whole weekend at Mount Washington was just such an incredible experience. We rode the course every day, we hung out with friends, we ate some food, drank some beer, watched people ride. Just overall just a great vibe.   This contest isn't over yet though.

So, if you're having trouble getting your horse to transition from trot to canter, try doing a leg yield and then asking for the transition.

It's easier on the horse. The horse doesn't have to figure out where they need to put their feet. They don't have to figure out where they need to bend. They just kind of move sideways.  That's why I love leg yielding so much.  Another good use of leg yielding is when you're working on your half passes.

She knew that if she could control the pace of the fight, she'd be able to control the outcome. So, she took her time. She took her time with every single strike. She waited for the perfect moment.

I'll probably end up adding another one or two ounces to the grip. But right now, I got about four ounces total in there. It feels pretty good. The only thing I'd say is if you're doing something like this where you're trying to get your balance point right, make sure you have a lot of string looped around the top of the handle so you can actually pull it down and feel how much weight it takes to hold it open because when you put your hand behind it, it's gonna push against your hand so you won't know exactly how much weight it needs to stay open. So make sure you have enough string wrapped around the top of the handle so you can actually pull it down and feel how much weight it takes to keep it from closing. And then once you figure out how much weight you need, then you can start figuring out where to put it. So far, I'm liking this setup quite a bit. I still haven't shot with my new rest yet. I haven't even mounted it onto the bow. I'm waiting till I get some arrows made up before I do that. But I did shoot with my old rest today just to test fit everything and it worked great. I had no problems shooting at all. The arrow flew perfectly fine. And I also wanted to mention that I did change the cam on this bow. I went from a 60 pound cam to a 55 pound cam. This is an older bow, but they used to sell these cams as an option for the 60 pound cams. They were called the \"Pro Series\". They came in 55 pounds, 60 pounds, and 65 pounds. This is a 55 pound Pro Series cam. It's a little heavier than what I normally shoot, but that way I could use some lighter strings without having to worry about breaking them. So I'm happy with it.

If this is too difficult, you can use a wall. Just make sure you keep the elbows locked out. After your five strict handstand push-ups, we're moving right into ten strict toes-to-bar. Start hanging from the bar. Pull your knees towards the bar while keeping that core tight. Try to avoid arching the low back. Ten strict toe touch or toe raise. Toe raise means just touching the toes to the bottom of the chin. Toe touch means bringing the feet all the way up so they touch the bar. The last exercise is ten strict ring dips. Hang from the rings. Your arms should be fully extended. Bend the elbows and bring the chest below parallel with the Rings. Don't swing. Don't use any momentum. Just strictly dip from the shoulders.

Not too steep, but long enough to make sure your legs are warmed up before heading downhill. Once we reach the top, we head straight down through the forest. These descents are really fun. They're technical, they're fast, and they're challenging. But because this is a Grizzly, it's also got big tires on it.

We will start by showing you the correct way of handling the rope. Your leading hand should be above your braking hand. This ensures that you always have enough slack in case of a fall. If you hold your hands below each other, you might not get enough slack when there is a sudden load on the rope. This could result in a serious injury for both you and your climber. So make sure that your leading hand is above your braking hand. Now we're going to explain what happens when the climber falls. When the climber falls, all the weight comes onto the rope. As soon as the weight reaches the brake hand, it starts pulling down against the force from the leading hand. As long as these forces are equal, there is no movement of the climber. In order to make sure that these forces remain balanced, we recommend using an additional carabiner attached to your harness. It is also possible to use a harness with built-in brake handles. With this technique, both hands are below each other. Again, make sure that the brake cable runs on the healthy side of the carabiner. And again, check whether the knot turns. That's it!

There's no real harshness or jarring from the road surface.   A little bit of extra weight with the suspension fork, but not much.   Off-roading isn't too bad. Not too many technical sections today, but there was enough for me to get used to this bike.   The tires were 40c wide, which gave plenty of traction.

There's no movement at all. That's pretty cool. I think you might be able to tell whether there's movement or not because when I was using the chest mount before, when I went over bumps, the whole camera would move up and down.

My helmet has got some kind of weird shape going on. And as a result, whenever I look down, the camera sort of tilts upwards slightly. Which isn't ideal. But other than that, everything seems fine. And hopefully, hopefully, fingers crossed, everything should be okay. We shall see. We shall see. If nothing else, at least I won't get bored while riding.

But unfortunately, I didn't get any good footage because he kept running away from me and I couldn't really chase after him because I had my phone in hand. But anyways, let's jump into today's workout. We're going to be doing a full body workout and I'm going to start off with some squats. And since I've been doing some heavy squatting lately, we're going to do something different today. We're going to do some pause squats. So what I did was I started out with 135 pounds for three sets of ten reps. Then I moved up to 225 pounds for two sets of five reps. Then finally moved up to my working set which is 315 pounds for one set of four reps. Now, I know that these numbers aren't very impressive at all. But honestly, I feel like they were pretty challenging considering how much weight I have been lifting recently. Also, I feel like pausing your weight at the bottom position helps you activate more muscle fibers which will lead to better gains. Afterwards, I went ahead and hit some chest work. Now, since I haven't done any chest workouts in about a week, I decided to keep things simple by only hitting bench press and incline dumbbell presses. For bench press, I started off by warming up with 135 pounds for about three sets of ten reps. Then after that, I went straight into two sets of five reps using 225 pounds. Finally, I finished off with one set of four reps using 315 pounds. After finishing those sets, it felt like my chest was completely fried. It definitely felt good though. Anyways, moving on from bench press, I went ahead and hit some incline dumbbell presses. For this exercise, I warmed up with 135 pounds for three sets of ten reps. Then afterwards, I did two sets of five reps using 225 pounds. To finish everything off, I ended things off with one set of four reps using 315 pounds. That concludes our workout for today.

The swim was pretty good. It wasn't as fast as I wanted to go, but I felt like it went well. The bike was great. I rode with some of the best guys out there.

It looks like they might even take the lead. Yeah, I mean, you'd expect the Leander crew to come through because they were so far behind. But the Hungarians look really solid. They're keeping nice and smooth. They're moving through their strokes really well. And they're just holding on to this slight advantage. We haven't seen any dramas from either of these crews.

It's also one of the most dangerous sports around the globe because of how high people jump off of things like this basketball court or off of buildings or whatever else they can find.

{"video_id": "fPdNuAh5SUM", "video_start": 76.761, "video_end": 140.022, "pred": "Well, after riding with the Shimano M200 brakes, I found that there's three things to keep in mind when you're using them. First thing is the lever feel. The lever feels really mushy and soft. There's no real feedback or bite when you squeeze the levers together. Second thing is the amount of force required to actually stop your bike. They require a lot of force in order to bring your bike to a complete stop. And thirdly, the amount of modulation or control over your braking system. There isn't any. It's either all on or all off. When you're going downhills at high speeds, if you want to slow down a little bit, it's very difficult to do so because you don't have any control over the modulation of the brakes. So what I'm looking forward to most about upgrading my brakes is having more control over how much pressure I apply to each side of the brake caliper. That way I could be able to modulate my speed better while descending downhill trails. The other reason why I wanted to upgrade was because I felt like these brakes were slowing me down too much. They weren't allowing me to maintain speed through corners and technical sections of the trail. Now let's swap out those old brakes and see how well those new ones work.

And then here is set number two where I went ahead and went up to 245 pounds for another three reps. Again, bar speed looks okay. And here is set number three where I went ahead and tried to hit 315 pounds for five reps. Now, again, my lower back wasn't feeling very great so I didn't want to push myself too far.

It's always good to have a partner when you're doing these exercises because they can help you out by spotting you, and also helping you get the weight back down if it gets too heavy for you.  Today is leg day. We're gonna start off with front squats. We're gonna move our way on over to leg presses and then we'll finish up with a nice finisher in Bulgarian split squats. The first exercise that we started off with was front squats. This is one of my favorite exercises to use as far as building your legs because it works all three heads of your quadriceps. It hits them from all angles so this exercise will definitely give your legs a great pump. What makes this exercise so effective is that when you put the barbell on your shoulders like this, it takes away some of the pressure from your lower back. So if you've ever had any lower back issues or anything like that, this is an awesome exercise to try. So after we finished off with front squats, we moved our way onto leg presses. Now with leg presses there's two ways that you could go about using this machine. You could either use it as a strength builder or you could use it as a mass builder. If you want to build strength, you would just use lighter weights but do more reps. If you want to build mass, you'd use heavier weights but less reps. But since we were trying to hit both goals, we went ahead and used medium weights and medium reps. The key thing about using this machine is making sure that you keep constant tension on your muscles throughout the entire movement. And also make sure that you sink your hips down low enough where they stay below the top of your knee. That's how you know you're getting full range of motion. And once again, don't forget to breathe! That's very important. Breathing helps oxygenate those muscles which helps you perform better in the long run. After we finished our leg presses, we moved our way onto one of my favorite finishing moves: Bulgarian split squats. These are awesome because not only does it target your quadricep muscle group, but it targets your glutes and hamstrings at the same time. This is why I love these so much. They're great for finishing off any type of workout. They're also great for building overall body stability. When performing this exercise, be sure to control every single part of the movement. Don't just let yourself fall backwards into the squatting position. Make sure that you push through your heels and drive through those toes. Also, make sure that you keep your chest up high during every rep. That's going to ensure that you maintain proper form. Also, remember to breathe while you're doing this movement. That's very important. Once again,", "event_id": 2}

And then we went to the rodeo arena and we practiced some barrels. I'm practicing my turns on Max. He's getting better at turning. But he still needs a lot more work. Cashlin took Max through the barrels and did awesome. He wasn't very fast but he turned really good. She did an amazing job. Good girl, cashlin.   Then we went home and had dinner.

This is something that we've talked about before, but when you're striking with your stick, if you come straight out and you hit somebody in the face or the body, they might be able to block it. If you go at an angle, like this, they don't know where your strikes coming from. They also won't see where my follow-up strikes are coming from. That's why using an angle of attack is important for using any weapon, not just sticks. You want to make sure that when you're attacking someone, whether it's with a knife, or a stick, or even if you're just punching them, you want to make sure that you're hitting at different angles because that makes them harder to defend against. If I'm always coming straight forward, they'll learn how to block me. But if I'm changing my angles, they won't know which one to block. They won't know which direction I'm coming from. And that's gonna make things much more difficult for them to defend against. So remember:", "event_id": 6}
