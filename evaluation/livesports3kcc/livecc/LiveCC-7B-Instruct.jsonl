So what I'm going to do here is show you some different exercises that can help with your upper body explosiveness. The first one's called a box jump. So you want to get into a push -up position. What you're going to do is you're just going to jump up onto the box as high as possible. You don't have to go all the way over it. Just try to get as much height as you can. And then when you come back down, try not to touch the ground. Just kind of like a little mini push-up. And then right away, explode again. Try to keep your arms straight. Don't bend them too much. Jump up.  Okay? That's the first exercise. The second one is called a burpee. It's very similar to the box jump except for there's no box. So let me demonstrate that now....", "event_id": 3}

But it looks like they've done their job for today. They've taken care of their man. They've kept him up front. Now they can get some rest and recuperation before tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, this is what you want to do when you go into this race. You don't want to be... overly aggressive on day one because there's so much racing left in this tour.

So what I want to do is I want to start working on getting out from under him. So I'm going to take one leg and I'm just going to push it up against his hip bone right there. And then with my other hand, I'm going to grab onto that leg as well. And now what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to pull myself back up into a seated position. Okay? Now if you're having trouble doing that, you can also use your hands for leverage. But again, we don't really need our hands for anything else at this point. We've already secured the arm bar. We've got our hooks in place. All we're trying to do is get ourselves out from underneath him so we can finish the arm bar. Okay? So once I get myself up into a seated position like this, now I'm able to finish the arm bar because he doesn't have any way to defend it anymore. He has no way to stop me from finishing this arm bar. If he tries to roll away, all I have to do is keep pulling down on his elbow to make sure that he stays in this position. Okay? If he starts rolling away, all I have to do is keep pulling down on his elbow until he stops rolling. But if he doesn't roll, then I'll go ahead and finish the arm bar. Okay? So let's look at another example where maybe we're not quite in the perfect spot yet. Maybe his arm is still kind of extended or whatever. What I'm going to do is I'm going to come back around to the side here. And I'm going to put my knee right against his shoulder blade like this. And then I'm going to bring my knee across his body so that I can sit down on top of him. Okay? Once I'm sitting down on top of him, then I'm going to be able to grab hold of his wrist with both hands. And now I'm going to start pushing his arm across his chest. Okay? As soon as I feel his arm cross his chest, then I know that I'm going to be able to secure the arm bar. Okay? Now, if he does manage to roll away, which he probably will at some point, all I have to do is follow him by bringing my hips forward. Okay? As long as I stay close enough to him, I should be able to secure the arm bar even after he rolls away. Okay? So those are two different ways of securing the arm bar when you're in this position. One is using your feet to help lift yourself out from underneath them. The second is using your knees to help lift yourself out from underneath them. Either way works fine.

So we still have a long way to go before we figure out how good we can actually be. But I'm excited for us to see where we end up at the end of the season. Our goal is always to make it to state. That's kind of like our ultimate goal every year. That's why we're here today. It's not just to win one game. It's not even to win 10 games. It's to try to make it to state. So that's kind of our goal. But right now, we're just trying to focus on getting better with each game. Getting better with each day. The girls did a great job tonight. They were very aggressive. They were very physical. They served well. They passed well. They hit well. They blocked well. They dug well. They had good energy. They worked together. They supported each other. They cheered each other on. They didn't give up when they got down. They kept fighting back. They never gave up. Yeah, we definitely have a lot of things to work on. We're new as a team. We haven't been playing together very much. So... Yeah, but we're gonna work through all these little problems and hopefully we'll come out stronger and better than ever.   Well, we're looking forward to playing Yorkville again tomorrow night. Hopefully we can take them twice in a row. Hopefully we can beat them both times. We want to move into first place so we can stay there for the rest of the season....", "event_id": 2}

{"video_id": "Bde6YJSgkNM", "begin": 360.57, "end": 532.359, "pred": "I think that's pretty good for a first shot at 25 yards with this gun. I mean, it was pretty close together. And then we had one here in the top left corner. So maybe just a little bit high or low there. But that could have been me as well. But again, this is my second time shooting this gun. So it's not like I'm super familiar with it yet. But you can see here, we've got two shots right next to each other. And then these three shots were all within about an inch of each other. So I would say the accuracy out of this gun is definitely acceptable. You know, if you're going to be using this for home defense, you'd probably want to get some more practice than what I did today. But even so, if you look at where those two shots landed, they're both right below the nose bone area. So if you're using this for home defense, and you shoot somebody in the face, they're going to be down. They're going to be hurt. They're going to be incapacitated. That's really all you need from your home defense weapon. So I don't think accuracy is too much of an issue with this gun. Now, obviously, if you're going to use this for hunting, then you might want to do a lot more practice. But again, I wouldn't worry too much about accuracy because these shots are still within... about an inch of each other. If you're going to be hunting something like deer or something like that, you'll probably want to put them somewhere else on the body. Maybe somewhere around the shoulder or chest. But even so, I think those shots are still acceptable. All right guys, so let's take a closer look at some of these holes. As you can see, there's quite a few different holes up here near the top. These ones over here are actually from the first round that I fired through this target. These ones over here are from the second round. And then these ones over here are from the third round. Now, as far as the fourth round goes, I didn't fire any rounds through this target during the fourth round. That was when I was switching magazines. So I only fired four rounds total through this target. And as you can see, all four of those rounds hit the same hole. So that tells us something about how consistent this gun is. It seems very consistent. It doesn't seem to cycle any ammo back into the chamber. The trigger pull feels consistent throughout. And every single time I pulled the trigger, every single bullet went off exactly where I wanted it to go. So overall, I think this gun has been very reliable. Very accurate. Again, I haven't done enough practice with it to tell you whether or not it's comfortable to shoot. But based on what I saw today, I think it will be. And also, one thing I noticed while looking at these holes is that none of these bullets actually penetrated the cardboard. So obviously, this cardboard isn't going to stop anything. But I thought that was kind of interesting because most handguns will penetrate cardboard. This one does not. So maybe that's another reason why people choose to carry pistols instead of revolvers. Because pistols tend to penetrate better than revolvers. So overall, I think this gun is great. I think it's a great option for people who want to carry a revolver but don't necessarily want to spend $1 ,000 on a Smith & Wesson M&P Shield. Or maybe just $500 on a Glock 19. I think this gun is a great option for people who want to carry a revolver but don't really care about having multiple calibers. And I think it's a great option for people who want to use their handgun for hunting. Because most handguns aren't designed to hunt. Most handguns are designed to protect yourself. And this gun is no exception. It's designed to protect yourself. But it's also capable of taking down small game animals. So if you're looking for a gun that you can hunt with, I think this would be a great choice. And I think it's a great choice for anybody who wants to protect themselves.

We've got our lead rope in one hand. We have our other hand up by her head. And then we're just going to walk her around. And as she starts to move, you can feel how loose the girth is. You can also feel if your horse is comfortable with it. If they start moving away from you, then maybe you need to tighten it up a little bit more. But if they stay nice and close to you, then you know everything is good. So that's all there really is to adjusting your girth. It's pretty simple. It doesn't take very long at all.

It wasn't really heavy at all. It was just 215 pounds. But as you can see right there, my legs were shaking like crazy. And then when I got up off the bench, they were still shaking. And so that's why I said in the beginning of the video that your mind plays such a big role during these deloading weeks because if you're not mentally prepared for them, you might be able to lift more weight than what you normally would have been lifting. Now, obviously, this isn't going to happen every single time. There will be times where you do feel weak or tired. But if you mentally prepare yourself for those days, then you'll probably get better results out of your training sessions. So now let me show you some other exercises from this workout. The next exercise we did were incline dumbbell presses. We did three sets with these. We started off with 100 pound dumbbells. Then we moved down to 90 pound dumbbells. Then we went back up to 100 pound dumbbells again. So each set had different weights. And then after that, we finished off our chest workout by doing some tricep pushdowns. We did four sets of eight reps with these. Now, the reason why I chose to finish off my chest workout with triceps instead of another chest exercise is because it helps build strength in your elbows. And since we've already done two exercises involving your elbows, which are bench press and incline dumbbell presses, doing something else involving your elbows could potentially put too much stress on them.

Muscular Development just announced that the Arnold Classic is happening this year. And Ron Harris from Muscular Development did a video discussing some details about it. So let's get into that right now. Now, first things first, let me say that I'm very excited that the Arnold Classic is happening this year. It was looking pretty doubtful at one point, but it looks like it's happening. And I'm sure there'll be plenty of people who want to go to the Arnold Classic and watch it live. However, there are some questions about its viability. For example, will it actually take place? Will it be held in Columbus, Ohio? Or will it be held somewhere else? Or will it be held in California instead? Because California has been having a lot of issues with coronavirus lately. And then also, what kind of attendance can we expect? Will there be a huge crowd? Or will there only be a small crowd? Because obviously with coronavirus, you can't have big crowds anymore. And then finally, when is it going to be? Is it going to be in March? Is it going to be in April? Or is it going to be in May? We don't know yet. Ron Harris says he doesn't know either. But he does mention something interesting. He mentions September 25th. He says that if the Arnold Classic is indeed taking place on September 25th, then it won't be counting towards the qualification window for next year's Mr. Olympia.

But after that first barrel, he did really well. And you can see here how much better he is getting at turning his head and looking back. But yeah, so my little brother went through as well. And here he is doing his barrel race. And he actually won this class. So that was super exciting for him. And then we ended up winning a couple other classes as well. We didn't win them all, but it was still fun. And yeah, so afterwards... We were pretty tired from riding all morning long. So we decided to go home for lunch. And then afterwards we came back out again to do some more riding. So we started off by doing some more barrel racing practice. And then we moved on to some drills. So I rode Max through these drills. And what I wanted to work on with him was getting him to stay straighter when I asked him to stop. Because right now when I ask him to stop, he tends to veer off to one side or another. So I want him to stay straighter than he has been in the past. And then my friend Emily came over and she brought her horse over. And she let me ride him around because she needed help with some things. And he was such a sweetheart. He was so easy to ride. And he was very fast. So I definitely need to get more comfortable sitting back and letting him run around. Because if not, then I'll end up pulling up on him and slowing him down too much. But overall, he was great. And I hope to have him again soon. Afterwards, we worked on some more drills. And what I wanted to work on with Colt was getting him to turn left better. Because right now he likes turning right better than left. Then my sister got on him and did some more barrel practice. And she also won her class. She was so excited about that. And then we finished out the night with some more drills. And what I wanted to work on with him was just making sure that he was staying straighter than he has been in the past. And then we also worked on some circles. And I tried to make sure that he stayed straighter while I was doing those circles. And then we ended the night with some more barrels. And I made sure that Colt kept his head up while going through the barrels.  And then we walked the horses out. And they both did really well. They were calm and relaxed. And they were listening to us very well. And then we took them home. And we gave them their dinner. And then we put them away for the night. And then we headed home ourselves. And overall, I would say that today was a success. Both of the horses did really well. And I learned a lot from riding them. And I'm glad that I got to spend time with both of them. And I'm glad that I could help my family members ride them as well. And then before we left, we cleaned up the arena. My little sister helped me sweep the ground. And then we put everything away. And then we headed home. Overall, I'd say that today was a success. The horses did great. They listened to us very well. And I learned a lot about each of them.

The reason they're facing outwards is because when I put my magazine pouches on there, they'll be facing inward. That way if something happens to them, they won't fall off. Now, you can use separate magnets or you can attach the magnet directly to your pouch. It doesn't really matter.

If you want to see more videos like this, make sure sure to subscribe down below. So today we'll be talking about tips for gaining and how to overcome your fear of them. So let's get into it. The first tip that I have for you guys is just to practice. I know that sounds really obvious, but it's true. The more you do something, the better you become at it. And then eventually you won't even think about doing it anymore because it will become second nature. So what I mean by practicing is just getting out there and trying them over and over again until you feel comfortable with them. Now when you start off learning a gainer, you might not be able to go very high at all. But as long as you keep practicing, you can always build up your strength and power in order to get higher and higher. Another thing that helps me with gaining is just watching other people do them. This way you can learn from their mistakes and also pick up some tips along the way. Now another big problem people face when they try to learn a gainer is that they don't trust themselves enough in order to actually commit to doing one. And so what happens is they end up falling on their butt or landing awkwardly because they didn't fully commit to their movement. But once you've practiced enough times where you feel confident in yourself, then you should be able to land perfectly every single time. So now I'm going to show you guys some examples of what I was talking...", "event_id": 6}

So this was a very interesting fight because it's a bantamweight fight that was supposed to happen at UFC 259 but then got canceled for some reason. And now they've rescheduled it for UFC 261. But I'm just going to talk about the fighters themselves. So first off, Wu Yanan. She has been fighting since 2015. She's from China. She's 29 years old. She's 11 -4 as a pro. She made her debut with UFC in 2019. She's fought twice inside of the octagon so far. Her first fight she lost by decision against Megan Anderson. And then her second fight she won by decision against Katlyn Chen. Now Joseline Edwards, she's also from Canada. She's 29 years old. She's 11 -4 as a pro. She debuted with UFC in 2018. She's only had two fights inside of the octagon. Her first fight she won by submission against Roxanne Modafferi. And then her second fight she won by TKO against Katlyn Chen. So these two women have faced each other before. They both beat Katlyn Chen. But I think this will be a really good matchup between them. Because they're both pretty similar in terms of their skillset. They're both mixed martial artists. Both of them have experience in boxing, wrestling, and Brazilian jiu -jitsu. Now, Joseline Edwards does have more experience in MMA than Wu Yanan. She's been doing this longer. She's older. She's been training longer. But I do feel like Wu Yanan might have better striking skills. Because she did win her last fight by knockout. And she's actually knocked out three people before. So I don't know if she can knock out Joseline Edwards or not. But I definitely see her winning by submission. Or maybe even knocking her out. But I think she'll probably get the win by submission. Because Joseline Edwards doesn't have much experience in striking. She hasn't done any kickboxing or anything like that. So I think Wu Yanan would probably take her down early on and start working on submissions. And...", "event_id": 6}

It's just not going to have quite as much distance potential as some other clubs in this lineup. But if you're looking for something with more control, something that's going to give you more spin off the face, this might be your best bet. So let me know what you guys think about these numbers down below in the comments section. I'd love to hear from you. And then we'll go ahead and take a look at some comparisons here between these two clubs. So first up, we've got the M2 Tour and the M2. And so again, just like we saw with the M2 Pro versus the M2, we see that launch angle has gone down by 1 degree. We also see that carry distance has gone down by about 10 yards or so. But overall, it looks like the ball speed wasn't affected too much. It was only like half a mile per hour difference. And then overall, the spin rate went up by about 100 RPMs. So again, that makes sense because of the fact that they added weight into the toe area to help promote spin rates. Now, when we compare the M2 Tour to the M2 Pro, which is another club that had a lot of weight added to the toe area, we can see that the launch angles were actually very similar. The carry distances were almost identical. The spin rates were almost identical. So really, there wasn't any difference between those two clubs. And then finally, when we compare them to the M2 Max, which is the longest club in the lineup, we can see that the launch angles were actually very close. Carry distances were also very close. Spin rates were very close. Ball speeds were only slightly different. So all things considered, they seem to perform pretty similarly. Now, let's take a look at some of the trackman data here. We can see that the clubface was open by about one and a half degrees at impact. That's probably due to my swing path being slightly closed. Clubhead speed was around 142 miles per hour. Total spin was around 3 ,200 RPMs. And then we can see that the ball was traveling left with a draw shape. So overall, not bad results here. Again, I'm sure most people will get better than mine. But yeah, so far, I'm liking the way this club feels. Feels solid off the face. Looks great. Sounds great. And I think it's definitely one of the better options out there right now.

That put him way back in the field when the race started. And then there were more problems later in the season. At Watkins Glen, he had trouble getting his car out of the pits. So how did Elliott go from struggling to winning? Well, it took a lot of hard work and dedication from everyone involved with the No. 9 team. They worked together as a unit to get things right.

As you can see, there are many boats racing today at the regatta. These include both single sculls and double sculls. Single skulls are raced by one person while double skulls are raced by two people. There are different types of single and double skulls including lightweight, women's, junior and master classes. Lightweight means that the boat is lighter than normal while women's refers to female rowers only. Junior means that the rower must be under 18 years old while master means that the rower must be over 35 years old. So let's take a closer look at these boats and how...", "event_id": 13}

So we'll start with the barbell cluster. The goal here is to keep your back straight as you pull up into that full lockout. If you need to use some momentum off the ground, go ahead and do so. Just make sure you finish in that locked out position. Then after each set of nine reps, we'll move right into our strict pull-ups. Make sure when you come down to the bottom position, your chin clears the top of the bar. And then at the top, we want to squeeze those shoulder blades together. For home gym variation, we'll scale back to dumbbells. So instead of doing barbell clusters, we'll just do dumbbell clusters. Same thing applies. You can use momentum if needed. Just make sure you get all those reps up overhead. After each set of nine, we'll move right into our strict pull -ups. Same rules apply. Chin over the top of the bar, squeezing those shoulder blades together at the top.   Alright, let's take it through this workout. Start by setting up your equipment. If you're using dumbbells, grab them from the floor. Get ready to go. When the timer starts, start moving. First round will be strict pull -ups. Once you've completed all 11 reps, move directly into your barbell cluster. Complete that first round without resting. Once you complete all nine sets, then rest two minutes before moving on to the next round. Have fun, guys. See you tomorrow....", "event_id": 8}

He has his hands up. He's got his head tucked down. So what do I want? I want him to be able to get up off me so he can't defend himself anymore. So when I go for this position, it's not just about getting that arm bar or getting that triangle. It's also about making sure they don't have any space to defend themselves. So if I come over here like this, he's still got space to get back into guard. If I come over here, still got space to get back into guard. If I come all the way over here, now he doesn't have any space to get back into guard. Okay? So let's say I've got my guy right here. And he's got his hand up. He's got his head tucked down. What am I gonna do? Well, first thing I need to do is make sure I keep him close to me. Okay? Because if he gets away from me, then he'll start to push me out with his hips. And once he starts pushing me out with his hips, then... Now I'm stuck here. Because look at where he is. He's already starting to get away from me. And as soon as he gets away from me, now he's got room to start defending himself. Right? So I need to stay close to him. But I also need to make sure that I'm keeping pressure on him. So I'm going to put some weight down onto him. And I'm going to use my left hand to pull him closer to me. Now watch what happens if I try to grab his wrist. See how he pulls his arm away? That's why I always grab his sleeve instead. It makes it harder for him to pull his arm away because it's attached to his body. All right? So I'm pulling him towards me. I'm putting weight down onto him. And I'm using my left foot to drive forward. All right? So I'm driving forward with my left leg. My right knee comes in between his legs. And I'm going to hook his leg. My right foot hooks his ankle. And I'm going to bring my right elbow across the front of his neck. Now notice how I'm not grabbing his wrist. I'm grabbing his forearms. That way even if he tries to turn this way, I'm still holding on to him. Right? So I'm going to hold on to his forearms. I'm going to take my left knee and slide it under his armpit.

So if I just hit one more shot here, and I've got 147 ball speed, which was quite good, but again, I didn't feel like I had any power behind it. If I could just keep those hands moving forward, get them into impact first, then move my hips through, that would be great. So I'm trying to get my hips turning before my arms start coming up. There we go. That felt better. It felt like I had some power behind it. And again, it wasn't too bad off the face. It wasn't perfect, but it was better than the other ones.

Instead, try landing on your toes first with your knees slightly bent. That way you absorb the impact better. Secondly, your stride length will change because the sand will slow you down.

As you can see here I got the whip but unfortunately my front tire hit the ledge which made me fall off. So that wasn't good enough for me. Let's do it again. Okay, so now I've got the whip again but when I landed I lost all speed which meant I couldn't make it around the corner. So let's try one more time.   Okay, so now I've got the whip and I also managed to land with speed. But unfortunately I fell down because I had no idea where to pedal because I wasn't used to riding without pedals. So yeah, that was kind of sketchy. But anyway, let's keep trying until I finally get it right.   Okay, so after trying for quite a while finally got the trick done. Yeah, pretty happy about that. Now let's move on to something else.  All right, so next up I want to try a tailwhip over this hip. It's actually quite small compared to what you would normally use for a tailwhip. But since I haven't tried one before I thought why not try it here. So let's see if I can pull it off.  Okay, so first attempt went okay. Got the whip over the lip but then I crashed into the wall.

On the last lap, Pearson made contact with leader Richard Petty's car in turn three, forcing him wide. Then he drove through the middle of the racetrack to take the lead on the front stretch. Petty tried to get by him again as they entered turn one, but Pearson held his ground. The two cars crossed the line side by side, giving Pearson his first win since Daytona in March. It would be his only win of the season. And it would also be his last ever victory. The next race, Pearson announced his retirement from full -time racing. I think I'm going to go out on top, said David Pearson. That's what I want to do. I don't know if I'll ever drive again or not. I've got no plans right now. I'd like to have some fun this year. But I can tell you this much. If I never drive again, I will always remember that day when I beat Richard Petty.   Well, we're down to our number three moment. And it's another great story about David Pearson. We talked about how he won 12 times during the regular season. Well, he did something else during the regular season. He finished second or better in every race except for one. Now, that's pretty good. So, yeah, he wasn't quite able to pull off what he wanted to do here today. But he certainly put on a heck of a show. Yeah, you know, he really did. And he said himself, if I never drive again, I'll always remember beating Richard Petty.

But now back healthy, looking forward to seeing him come into his own again. Yeah, Ryan McConnell, like you said, had a lot of success early in his career. Had some struggles with injury. Now looking very healthy. Very excited to watch his season unfold. Well, Jesse Byrne gets the job done. Gets McConnell out of there safely. A little bit of a delayed reaction by McConnell. But Jesse Byrne does exactly what he needs to do. Gets him out of there. And as we've seen throughout these opening rounds, a lot of times those bulls will go after their rider. They don't want to give them an easy exit. And Jesse Byrne did a nice job there. Thank you for watching another PBR...", "event_id": 13}

The charge weight on them is about seven grains. It's a little bit less than what I would normally use, but he says they work really well. So we're going to give him a shot. These are loaded with the 230 grain Spear Gold Dot bullet. And they should have a muzzle velocity of around 1 ,000 feet per second. That's what he told me anyway.

Today we're going to be looking at some footage from my GoPro Hero 7 Black and comparing it with my GoPro Hero 7 Silver. So let's get right into it. I'm going to show you some footage that was shot in stabilization mode on both cameras at 1080p 60 frames per second. Let me know what you think down below. And if you like this kind of content, please subscribe for more videos just like this one. So here we go. First up, we have the Hero 7 Black. I'll put a link in the description below where you can pick these up online. And then after that, we'll move over to the Hero 7 Silver. Alrighty, so first off, we've got some footage from the Hero 7 Black mounted onto a chest mount. Now, as you may or may not know, the Hero 7 Black has a new feature called HyperSmooth. It's supposed to give you super smooth video without having to use any sort of external gimbals or stabilizers. But does it really work? Well... It depends on how much you want to trust your camera. If you're riding something like a bike trail, then yes, it works pretty well. However, when you start getting into stuff like jumps, drops, and other things where there's a lot of movement, this thing starts to struggle. The reason why is because HyperSmooth uses artificial intelligence to analyze your footage while it's being recorded. This means there's no way to turn it off once you hit record. That means every time you hit record, the camera is analyzing all the data coming out of its lens and trying to figure out what needs to be stabilized. When you do something like jump, drop, or anything else that involves a lot of sudden movements, the camera doesn't always have enough time to react quickly enough to keep everything smooth. Now, if you look closely at the footage, you might notice that sometimes the image looks really wavy. That's because the camera is actually trying to stabilize the image by moving the sensor around inside the camera. As you can see, when I'm doing something like jumping, the image gets pretty choppy. But overall, the stabilization does a decent job keeping things relatively smooth. Just don't expect too much out of it. If you need...", "event_id": 4}

It's not really that much higher but I'm going to be doing it with my feet together so that way I can get used to doing it without spreading them out too far. And then once again, you want to make sure your hands are up here in front of you and they're kind of like pushing forward as if you were going into a gainer. But instead of pushing forward, you're actually going to push backwards. So this will help you build momentum for when you do go into a gainer. And also, if you have any fear or anxiety about falling off the box, then this will help you overcome that. Because once again, you'll feel yourself falling backwards but not actually fall off the box. So yeah, let me show you guys how to do this. It's pretty simple. Just jump back with your arms extended behind you. And yeah, let's see how well I can do this. Alright, so now we've got our feet together. We're gonna jump back.  Okay, so now we're at the point where we need to start spreading our legs out while jumping back. Now, when you first try this, don't spread your legs all the way apart yet. Just spread them slightly apart because you still might lose your balance. So, just keep your arms extended behind you. Jump back, and then spread your legs slightly.  Yeah, as you can tell, I lost my balance there. But anyways, after you've done that a few times, you should be able to do it better. All right, so now we're ready to move on to the next step. We're finally getting close to actually learning how to do a gainer. So basically, what we're going to do is we're going to take all those steps from before and combine them into one fluid motion. So let me show you guys how to do that. You're going to put your hands down by your sides, put your feet shoulder width apart, and then basically just jump straight up and then land on your...", "event_id": 9}

It hit him right in front of his stick. He couldn't handle it. Haltigen had time to react. He put it home. Great job there by RIT. They've been able to do this all night long. They've been getting pucks through traffic. They've got good puck movement. That one looked like it might have gone off the skate of McClure as well. But RIT has done a really good job of keeping those pucks alive. And then when you can find guys like Brendan Holtgen who are willing to go out there and take shots at the net, that's what happens. You end up with goals. So I'm sure he'll tell you he didn't want to shoot it, but he did anyway. And he ended up putting it home. So great job there by RIT. Let's see if we can watch this again.

Now if I need to put another mag in there, I can just take this mag out of my pocket. Make sure it's empty by tapping it against something hard. Then what I'll do is I'll hold it between my thumb and my index finger so that way if any bullets fall out they're not going to hit me in the head. And then I will set them right back down where they were before. So now we've got our Y formation again. We'll come over here. We'll pick up our second mag. Set it down next to the first one.

And I'm not sure how many meters of climbing there was in that route. But it wasn't too bad at all. It was quite nice. So yeah, that's my first impressions of this bike. It's got a really low axle -to -crown height. So if you're looking for something with a bit more aggressive geometry than your standard road bike, then this might be something worth considering. The other thing I noticed straight away is just how light the frame feels. Now, obviously, we've got carbon wheels here as well, but even without those, you can tell that this frame has been designed with weight savings in mind. There's no extra material where it doesn't need to be. The other thing I like about this bike is the fact that they've gone for a full internal cable routing system. That means that when you get your bike serviced or when you want to change out your cables, you don't have to worry about any cables getting caught on anything underneath the bottom bracket shell. They're completely hidden inside the frame. Also, because everything's internal, it makes it much easier if you ever wanted to add some sort of electronic shifting or di2 later on. Because everything's already in place, you won't have to do any extra drilling into the frame. You'll just be able to run some new wires through the existing ones....", "event_id": 12}

It looks like he might have even improved upon his qualifying run here today. So we're going to see some really high scores coming up here for Brandon Semenek. Well, let's take another look at that run from Brandon Semenek. You can see how clean it was. It looked great. But now we've got Matty Mills. We saw him earlier in the day. He did not do well on his first attempt. Let's see if he can redeem himself now. Yeah, absolutely. We were talking about how he has been doing so well in the past couple of years. So we expect big things out of him. But sometimes you don't always get those results. So hopefully this will turn around for him right now. Oh yeah, he's looking pretty good. That was a nice backflip there. That was a little bit better than his last run. Wow!  What a run by Matty Mills. Now we've got Sam Pilgrim. This guy is... Unbelievable. He's done everything imaginable on a bike. He's won every single event he's entered. He's got two Red Bull X Games gold medals. He's got a whole bunch of other awards under his belt. He's just unstoppable. Sam Pilgrim, the man who does everything.  Look at that. The double backflip.   Oh my goodness.   That was amazing.   There's no doubt about it.

So if I'm going from a 180 to a backflip, it looks like this. But if I don't know how to blend them together, then my line will look something more like this. So let me show you what I mean by that. If I go into my 180 with no speed at all, then when I land, I have to stop and wait for my body to rotate around. And when I do that, I lose speed. So now I've got to get up on top of the trampoline again before I can even attempt the flip. And so... It'll be something like this. See?  Now, if I want to make my lines look smooth, I need to learn how to blend these two tricks together. So as soon as I finish my 180, I keep going forward. That way I never have to slow down or stop before I try the next trick. The same thing goes for any other kind of trick combination too. For example, let's say we're doing a backflip followed by a frontflip. If I don't know how to blend those two tricks together, then they might end up looking something like this. But if I know how to blend them together, they should look something more like this. So instead of stopping after the first one, I just keep going forward until I hit the second one.

So he had to go into a little bit of a crawl kick there at the end. And that's what cost him that gold medal.  Yeah, but this guy right here, look at him. Look how fast he goes off the blocks. Look at those arms. That's why he won the gold medal. That's why he's going to win another one.   It's all about speed off the blocks. There we have our final results from the men's 100 freestyle. Jason Lezak wins it by almost half a second. Neil Walker in second place. Michael Klim third. Andrew Mewing fourth. Patrick Murphy fifth. Garrett Weber -Gale sixth.  Well, congratulations.

So let me show you what I mean by power generation here. So when I talk about generating power from my legs, what I mean is when I throw a punch, my body should move as one unit.

Some people may say that he doesn't need to lose weight at all. Some people will say he needs to lose some weight. Others might even say that he should gain some muscle mass. But to each their own. That being said, from what I can tell, his physique has definitely improved over time. In fact, when he fought Eddie Hall, he looked very lean. He looked like he could have lost a few pounds more. However, when he fought Simon Valili, which was just recently, he looked much bigger. He looked much stronger. And he also looked much more conditioned. So I do believe that Thor has been making progress over time. However, whether or not he needs to lose weight or gain weight, that's completely up to him. That's completely up to him and his team.

Zach Babo here with Inside Lacrosse and we're at Navy Lacrosse Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland where today the Midshipmen took down Lehigh by a final score of 14 -9. It was a great game for both teams but it was really a day where Navy got back on track after their loss to Johns Hopkins last week. They were able to get some great offense from their midfielders as well as their attackman. And they also had a good day defensively. They held Lehigh under ten goals for just the second time this season. And that was all thanks to the play of goalie Ryan Kern who made nine saves on the day. But let's take a look at how this one played out. The first quarter started off with a bang when Navy scored three times in the opening five minutes alone. The Mids would go up four nothing early before Lehigh could even get on the board. After that, though, the Hogs came roaring back. They scored six straight goals before the end of the first half to make it just a two goal deficit at halftime. But that's when Navy went into attack mode.

{"video_id": "U18FZlpSEU4", "begin": 242.432, "end": 328.172, "pred": "I'm going to show you how I do my final attempts and give some advice on them as well. So first thing you want to do when you're doing your final attempt is just get yourself ready for it. So what I like to do is stretch out all my muscles that I'll be using for this climb. And then once I've done that, what I like to do is go up the wall and try and find a good starting position. Now, if there's any holds that look really hard or really awkward, make sure to practice those before going into your final attempt because they can be quite tricky. Once you've found a good starting position, then you need to work out where you're going to place your feet. If you have a bad foot placement, it will affect how high you can reach with your arms. And also, if you don't have a good foot placement, you won't be able to move around very much when you're trying to finish the climb. So now we know where our feet are going to go, we need to think about where our hands are going to go. The best way to do this is by imagining yourself doing the climb in slow motion. This means that you can see every hold before you even touch it. It allows you to plan out exactly which moves you're going to use and which holds you're going to grab. When you're planning these moves, remember to keep in mind that you should always try and stay close to the wall so that you can use your body weight to help you move from one hold to another. If you find yourself too far away from the wall, you might not have enough power to pull yourself back onto the next hold. Once you've planned all your moves, you can start trying to put them together. Remember to take your time with each move and make sure that you feel comfortable with it before moving on. When you're putting these moves together, remember to keep in mind that it's better to do more than one move at a time rather than just one. That's because if you only do one move, you could end up losing grip on the last move and falling off. But if you do two moves at a time, you'll still have something to hold on to even if you lose grip on the first one. Now let me show you how I would do this climb. Remember to watch...", "event_id": 5}

Well, she gained a lot more energy than if she'd gone out hard from the beginning. So that's why I think that was such a smart move. But now... The question is can she hold on? Can she keep up this sort of pace? Because she's not looking very comfortable. But she's certainly got some experience under her belt.   Well, she's definitely looking comfortable. Look at that stride length. That's great form. Great technique.   Now, as we said earlier, it's always important for athletes to be able to judge their pace.

But look at all the water that's coming over the top of him. That's why he needs to be so deep because if he was too shallow, all that water would come over the top of him and wipeout.

And so I'm just looking forward to getting back to training now and getting ready for the next one.  The run course wasn't particularly hard. It was just long. And as you saw, there were a couple times when I got caught up behind people who were walking or running slow. And then I'd have to kind of slow down myself. And that's never fun.  One thing I noticed about the run course is that they had these little cones set up all over the place. And sometimes those cones would get knocked over. And if you hit them, they would bounce off your leg. And it hurt. So I don't know why they put those cones there. Maybe they thought it looked cool. Maybe they wanted us to look like race cars. Who knows? But anyway, yeah, it was a tough day.   Overall, though, I mean, I'm happy with the way I ran. I mean, I finished strong. I made no big mistakes. I stayed hydrated. I ate enough. And yeah, so... All in all, I'm happy with the way I ran. I'm glad I could come away with a win....", "event_id": 3}

It was only about three metres or so. But they're all sitting right on top of these rocks. They weren't moving around much. They were just sort of hanging out. So I threw my little soft plastic over the top of them. And sure enough, one came straight across and hit it. So we had a few casts with that. We caught two or three fish off those rocks. Then we moved down into the deeper water where there was more structure. There was some weed beds and things like that. And then we started throwing our jigs around. And we found another couple of schools of fish. So we spent quite a lot of time in that area. Just fishing different depths with soft plastics and jigs. And we managed to catch quite a few fish. The ones that we did catch off the rocks were pretty good size. Some of them were probably close to 50 centimetres. But most of them were probably between 40 and 45. Yeah, so yeah, we've been doing pretty well today. We've got a nice bag together. We'll see how we go tomorrow. Hopefully we can get something similar again. Thanks for watching guys.

We're going to be doing some armless darts today. So if you haven't seen our previous videos, go check them out. We've got tons of armless darts. So Jesse's going to show us how it works here. He's in his guard position. I'm going to come over top. Boom! And he's going to get that armless dart right there. Now we have two different ways to do this. One way is I can just grab him by his leg like so. Pull him up into me. And then from here, I'll take him down. Okay? Or what I could also do... Is I can grab his head. Grab his wrist. Bring his hand behind him. Now I'm going to bring my knee across. My foot goes on the ground. My other foot comes around. From here, I'm going to pull this elbow towards me. This hand will come underneath his chin. And now I'm going to push down on his shoulder. As I push down on his shoulder, I want to make sure that I keep my chest over his hip. If I don't, he might start to roll away. See how he starts to roll away? That's not good for us. So I need to make sure that I stay tight with my chest over his hip. From here, I'm going to push down on his shoulder. I'm going to kick out. And as I kick out, I'm going to slide my knee through. And now I'm going to finish it off. Okay? One more time.  Pushing down on his shoulder. Kicking out. Sliding my knee through. And finishing it off. All right? Let's see it again. Pushing down on his shoulder. Kicking out. Sliding my knee through. And finishing it off. All right? That's all there is to it. Just remember when you're pushing down on his shoulder, keep your chest over his hips. If you let your chest drop, you're going to lose control. He's going to start rolling away. You're going to end up losing control. He's going to turn into you. And now you're stuck in a bad position. So always make sure that you stay tight with your chest over his hips. Push down on his shoulder. Kick out. Slide your knee through. Finish it off. All right? Another thing too, if you notice, when I was coming through, I had my elbow tucked under his armpit. When I came through, I didn't want to leave any space between my body and his body. So I kept my elbow tucked under his armpit. As soon as I came through, I kicked out. And then I slid my knee through. Okay? So once again, push down on his shoulder. Keep your chest over his hips. Kick out. Slide your knee through. Make sure you tuck your elbow under his armpit. And then finish it off. All right? There you go. Hope you enjoyed today's lesson.

So first thing I want you guys to know about learning gainer is that it's not about jumping up in the air and doing this. It's actually more like this. So what we're trying to do with our legs is just get them as high as possible so they can go over the obstacle without having to jump very far at all. And then once your legs are high enough, you'll be able to just throw your arms forward like that. Okay, now for learning gainers off a low ledge, what you need to do is find something soft to land on because if you fall down onto concrete or something hard, you could hurt yourself. So here I have a bean bag that will work perfectly fine. Now when you start out, it might feel weird landing on one foot instead of two, but once you get used to it, it won't really matter. And also make sure your feet aren't too close together because otherwise you won't be able to clear this gap right here. But yeah, let me show you some examples of what it looks like and then we'll talk more about it after. So basically what you want to do is put your hands behind your back so you don't trip over them, step up, and then just try to jump straight into the air. It doesn't matter where you land, but just try to keep your body straight and level while you're...", "event_id": 7}

Let's start off here at Delaware where they took down number nine Rutgers today. The Blue Hens were led by senior attackman Matt Mottet who had six goals in the win over the Scarlet Knights. The Hens have now won four straight games after starting the season with two losses. And speaking of wins, here's one of my favorite plays from the game. Mottet gets it out front for a nice finish there. But let's go back to the beginning of that play because he does an excellent job getting his stick free right here. He's able to get it out front and then just finds the open man. That's what makes him so good. He can score himself but also find his teammates.

That triple lutz triple toe combination is one of the most difficult elements you can do in women's figure skating. It's three rotations in the air. The first jump is on your left foot, so it's very hard to get into position for the second jump. But if you're going to go big, you have to put those two biggest jumps together.   There's another double axel.   Kaitlin Osmond from Canada has been very consistent all year long. She's always been able to land her jumps.

So let's get started with the tips and tricks that I have for you today. So first of all what we need to do is we need to make sure that our grip strength is good enough so we can hold onto the tire properly. And once your grip strength is good enough, you should be able to flip it over like this. Now there are two ways in which you can actually flip over the tire. One way is by using your legs to push down on the tire and then pushing off from your arms. And another way is just by using your arms to lift up the tire. Now both these methods work but one thing that you need to keep in mind is when you're lifting up the tire, you don't want to lift it too high because if you do that, there's a chance that you might drop it or injure yourself. So when you're doing this exercise, try not to lift it higher than shoulder height. Also, as you can see here, my friend has placed his foot inside the tire so he can use his foot as leverage while flipping the tire. But again, this is optional. If you feel comfortable doing without placing your foot inside the tire, go ahead and do that. The next tip that I would like to share with you is about how much force do you apply? When you're trying to flip the tire, you shouldn't apply too much force at once. You should gradually build up the force until you reach the point where you can actually flip the tire. So now that you know how to flip the tire, go ahead and practice it. Give it a shot and tell me in the comments below whether...", "event_id": 3}

They're both going to touch at the same time. And they did. But it was Grody who won by about a half second over Anton Ivesen. So Ivesen had a great kick off the wall. That's what you need to do if you want to win races. You've got to kick off the wall hard. And then you've got to keep your head up and just swim as fast as you can for those last few strokes. And that's exactly what Ivesen did. But it wasn't quite enough. Grody wins it again. A little bit of a disappointment for Ivesen. But still, great race from both of them. Great finish.

Their captain was Marcus Ehning who had won this competition twice before. He rode his horse Kashmir van 't Zonk first. He came back with a double clear. Then he rode his horse Cassini. That also came back with a double clear. So he gave them two clear rounds. And then he rode his third horse, which was Germanico T. That one did have four faults. But still, Germany finished up second overall after round one.   Well, Germany has been really consistent over the last few years. They've done quite well at World Equestrian Games. They've done well at the Olympics. They've done well in the Nations Cup. So yeah, they're definitely one of the top nations right now.   The final team to go were the Dutch. They had three riders who'd ridden for Great Britain before. The first rider for the Netherlands was Maikel Van der Vleuten. He rode his horse Quattro Bello....", "event_id": 6}

And again, it's interesting because the Dodgers were not able to use their challenge during the regular season. But now they can do so in the postseason. It's like a wild card for them. Yeah, exactly. That's right. And again, if they lose this challenge, then that's all they'll have for the rest of the series. Let's take another look. He does slide into second base. Utley tags him out. Does his hand stay on? Yeah, it looks like his hand stays on.   Okay, so we're waiting for the call from New York.  We're getting close to seven minutes.   And as we wait for the call, let me tell you something about these replays. They're incredible. You could watch them over and over and never really get tired of watching them. But you also realize how much time they take up. And as we wait for the call, let me ask you guys something. What would you rather have happen? Would you rather have the Mets win this game tonight with seven minutes taken away from us or would you rather have the Dodgers win this series tomorrow night with seven minutes taken away from us? Well, I'd rather have the Dodgers win the series tomorrow night. That way we only lose seven minutes instead of losing seven minutes tonight. Exactly.  Seven minutes isn't bad. It's better than losing 15. Absolutely.   And here comes the call.   And there it is.   Safe.   So the Mets will keep their leadoff man on base.  And now the Mets will go ahead to the bottom of the seventh inning with two outs and nobody on.  And the Dodgers will use their first challenge of the series.   And the Mets...", "event_id": 4}

They'll start shooting before they really get set up. So what we want them to do is get into position first.  So let's say he comes out from the left side.

And then finally, it was Ryan Creighton again who found Matt Kolodziecki once more for his second score of the game. And that would give them a three -goal lead after one quarter.  In the second quarter, Connor Kelly got things going with a nice finish over the shoulder. Then it was Ryan Creighton again who found Connor Kelly who scored his second goal of the game. After that, it was Matt Kolodziecki who finished off the quarter with a beautiful finish. That gave him two goals on the day as well.  The Tar Heels were not done yet though.

So we'll just watch again as this happens. You can see here that the crew from the right hand side of your screen are starting to move slightly towards the left hand side of the course. And then as they do that, their blades start to hit each other. Now I'm sure there was no ill intent from either crew. They were both just trying to steer themselves back onto the centre line. But unfortunately for the crew from the right hand side of your screen, they had already lost quite a bit of ground before that happened.

So let me show y 'all how this goes down. All right, so first things first, we gotta get our hands dirty. Get them gloves on. And then we'll start off by just picking up the stump. Now, if you can pick up one of these stumps like this, you should be able to lift a barbell pretty easily. But if not, no worries. You still want to work on your strength. So what he's doing now is he's getting into his squat position. He's going to hold it for about 10 seconds. He's going to come up. Hold it for about 10 more seconds. And then he's going to go ahead and drop it. Now, when you drop it, make sure you keep those legs straight. Don't bend those knees too much because that could cause injury. Just keep those legs nice and straight as you drop it. And then after you drop it, just repeat the process. Pick it up. Hold it for about 10 seconds. Come up. Hold it for about 10 more seconds. Drop it. Repeat the process until it gets heavy enough where you have to put it down. That's all you need to do. If you enjoyed this video, please give me a thumbs up.

So that would be like almost 2 ,000 pounds total. That's crazy. But yeah, so this is her first attempt here. She got it up pretty easily. Then we have another one from earlier in the year. It looks like she did this meet twice. So I'm not sure if they're going to count both of these or just one of them as records. But either way, she broke two world records today. So that's really cool. And you can see right there, it says 377 and a half kilograms. So that's about 832 pounds. And then she also did a bench press of 172 .5 kilograms. which is about 380 pounds. And then finally, she finished off with the deadlift at 292 .5 kilograms, which is about 644 pounds. So overall, she had a great day. Now let's go ahead and take a look at Jackson Powell. He has been doing some really impressive stuff lately. So he's only 15 years old, but he already squatted over 900 pounds. And now he's trying to break his own record by going for another 900 pound squat. So his last record was set back in March when he was able to do 835 pounds. And now he's trying to get up to 900 pounds. So he's using a little bit more weight here than he used before. And he's wearing knee sleeves as well. But overall, he looked very strong. He got it up without any problem. And then finally, we'll finish things off with another lift from Maddie. She's actually trying to beat her own world record. So last time she did 904 pounds. This time she's trying to get up to 927 .5 pounds. So she's adding quite a lot more weight here. It's almost like double what she did before. But again, she got it up no problem. And then after that, we saw her do a bench press of 441 pounds. So again, all three of those lifts were very impressive. And Maddie is definitely someone who should keep your eye out for because she's getting stronger every single week. And then finally, we have her finishing off with a deadlift of 700 pounds.

And he's had some big hits here in the playoffs as well. So we're going to see if he can do it again tonight.  The pitch coming from Dennis. Swing and a miss. Strike three called. That ball looked like it was down low. But the umpire said strike three. So now we have two outs. Pitch number one. Hit high into left field. Going back his left fielder. And he makes the catch. And that will end the inning. No runs scored. Two men left on base. We go to the bottom of the first with no score.  Well, I'm sure you've noticed that the wind is blowing out to right center field. It's about five miles per hour. And so far tonight, all the balls have gone out to right center field. So hopefully they'll keep doing that because that's where the home team likes them.  Now we move to the top of the second inning. The scoreless game. And we have Bob Barnes at bat. Number 21. And he swings and hits it hard. High into left field. Going back is the left fielder. And he looks up. And that ball is gone. A home run. And that gives the Howard's a 1 -0 lead.   Well, as you know, Bob Barnes has been hitting the ball pretty well throughout the season. And he continues his hot hand here in the playoffs. Now we move to the bottom of the third inning. Score still one nothing. Stan Harvey at bat. Number 29. And he gets ready to take pitch number one.

So this was the first time doing front squats since my knee surgery. And they felt pretty good. They're not as easy as they used to be because you have to keep your chest up. But overall, it wasn't too bad. We went up to 365 pounds for three reps. That was actually really good considering what I've been able to do before. Then we moved into some overhead press.

And that's because when you inhale, your diaphragm goes up into your chest. When you exhale, your diaphragm comes down into your stomach.

And then as soon as I got down low enough, I'd bring my right knee up. Now, you don't have to go too far back on this because you're still going to need your balance. But once you've gotten down low enough, bring your knee up. That gives you more stability and allows you to stay low longer without having to worry about falling over. Now, from here, you can either stay low and take shots or you can use it as a transition point where you can stand up and move forward. But again, the key thing is putting all your weight onto that front foot so that you can bend down and get low. Then stand back up and move forward.

So John, what do you got? So this is our magazine adapter for the Tippmann 98 and the Tippmann X7. It allows you to use your standard Tippmann magazines in your marker without having to modify them or anything like that. It just screws right into the bottom of the magazine. And then we have another one coming out for the X7 as well. That'll allow you to use any kind of standard Hopper Magazine in your marker. Okay, so how does it work? Well, basically all you need to do is take off the old adapter that comes with your marker. And if you don't know where that is, I'm sure there's some videos online showing you exactly where they go. But once you get it off, you can screw ours right onto the end of the barrel. And then you can put any kind of hopper mag on top of it. And it works great. What's the price point? The price point is $25 Canadian plus shipping. We ship worldwide. Where can people find more information? They can check us out at www .magentadapters .com. Okay, cool. Thanks, man. Hey, thanks for watching. Thanks for checking out my product. All right, man.  Alrighty, so we've been using these adapters all day long now. I think we had two different markers. One was a Tippmann 98, which was the original design. And then the other one was a Tippmann X7. Both worked really good. No issues whatsoever. One thing I did notice though with the Tippmann X7 is when you were shooting rapid fire, sometimes there would be a little bit of jamming because the hoppers weren't quite full enough. But overall, no issues whatsoever. They both worked very well. Now, I will say this. If you want to run these hoppers, you should probably run them with a co2 tank. You shouldn't try running them with compressed air. Because even though they fit perfectly fine, if you're running compressed air, you might not get enough pressure behind those balls to push them through the feed neck properly. So yeah, definitely recommend co2. Other than that, really nice products. Really easy to install. Just unscrew the old one, screw the new one on. Put your hopper on top. Works perfect every time. Definitely recommend checking them out. Check out their website. Link will be down below. If you haven't already, please hit subscribe. That way you won't miss out on any future videos.

It's not easy coming over here for the first time. The conditions aren't great. But you know what? They did everything right. They didn't panic when things weren't quite working out as well as they wanted. And that's why they came away with such an impressive win. Well, we can see there how much they enjoyed it. That's a nice way to end your race. Yeah, absolutely. That's a lovely shot. We saw the crew come through the line and then they just sort of relaxed into the finish. So you could tell they'd had a good day's work. So Sydney Rowing Club will go through to round two of this event tomorrow. They'll face another Australian crew in the form of Melbourne University.

We've got Denver at Towson in our first game today. The Pioneers were looking for their first win against a top 25 team since they beat Virginia Tech back in 2014. And it was a close one all day long. The Tigers had a two goal lead early on, but then the Pioneers took over. They scored four straight goals to take the lead into halftime. They led 7 -5 at that point. And then Towson came out strong in the second half. They tied it up at seven apiece with just under eight minutes left to play. But Denver would answer right back. They scored three straight goals to go ahead by as many as four. But Towson wouldn't give up. They cut it down to one with less than five minutes remaining. Then they missed some big opportunities late. And Denver held on for the victory. So the Pioneers improve to 3 -2 overall. Their next game will be against Cornell on April 1st.

Yeah, so the USA had a few chances during the second half. But unfortunately, they couldn't convert any more tries.

And as soon as you feel comfortable with that, start adding in your shots. So now I've got my shotgun out. And I'm still moving around. Now if you have a partner or somebody else to shoot at, great. If not, no big deal. You can still work on your footwork while you're shooting. But let me show you how this looks from behind. So I'll put one leg up here. And then I'll move over there. Now remember, the key thing about this drill is keeping your feet moving while you're shooting. That way you stay mobile. If you stand there in one spot, you're going to get shot down pretty quickly.

And what we're looking at doing is getting it up onto this green. So if you look down there, you can see how much slope there is from left to right. That's quite a lot. But also, as well as that, there's some slope from back to front. And that's where most people get confused with these shots. They don't know whether they should be hitting a chip or hit a pitch shot. Well, really, all you need to do is take your clubface and open it slightly. Just so when you strike the golf ball, it'll come out nice and softly. But then also, because of the fact that there's a little bit of slope coming downhill towards me, what I'm going to try and do is take a couple of practice swings to make sure that I have enough club head speed to actually get over those two feet of green. Okay? So let's give it a go. Open the face slightly. Take a few practice swings. Make sure I've got enough speed. And then once I feel like I've got enough speed, I'm going to go ahead and play through the shot.   Let's hope for the best.   Oh yeah!   Yeah!  There we go. That was pretty good.

So we're just getting ready for our next game here. We've got about 12 minutes left in this one. And then after this, we'll be done playing for today. We have two more games after this one. So it should be pretty fun. But yeah, so that was the end of the first half. It ended up being a really close game. It went down to the wire. The red team won by one point. And now we're moving into the second half. So let's go ahead and take a look at how the second half played out.  Alright guys, so as you saw from this last clip, we were able to get a couple kills right off the bat. And then we started pushing forward again. And we actually had a little bit of a lead early on. But then they came back and took over and pushed us all the way back into our spawn area. And then we kind of just stayed there until the very end. And then when the timer ran out, we lost the game. So unfortunately, our team did lose both games. But overall, it was still a lot of fun. And I think we learned a lot from these games. So hopefully we can come back next time and do better. But anyways, let's move on to the post -game recap. All right, so as far as the post -game recap goes, there wasn't too much to talk about because we didn't win any of the games. But overall, I thought we played pretty well. There were definitely some things that could improve though. One thing that we need to work on is communication. A lot of times we would call for people who weren't even available. Or sometimes people wouldn't hear us calling them. So we need to make sure that everyone is paying attention to what they're doing and making sure everyone hears each other. Another thing that we need to work on is shooting accuracy. Sometimes we'd miss shots where we knew we could hit them. And also, sometimes we'd shoot at targets where we shouldn't have been shooting. So we need to make sure that we're shooting at the correct targets and hitting those targets. Also, another thing that we need to work on is staying low while we're running. Sometimes we'd run around with our guns held high above us. And that made it easier for the enemy players to pick us off. So we need to make sure that we stay low while we're running around. Another thing that we need to work on is communication during reloads. Sometimes we'd start reloading before someone else was finished reloading. And that caused problems like ammo jams or having multiple people reload at once. So we need to make sure that we wait for each other before we start reloading. Also, another thing that we need to work on is taking cover. Sometimes we'd rush towards the enemy players without taking cover first. And that put us at risk of getting shot. So we need to make sure that we always take cover before rushing towards the enemy players. Overall, I think we played pretty well considering we only had six players. Hopefully we can come back next time and play better. But anyways, thanks for watching guys. If you enjoyed this video, please leave a like rating below.

This is your boy Lions Den Bill here and today we're going to be looking at a fight between Wu Yanan versus Joseline Edwards. Now this was a fight that took place in 2019 in China. It was part of the Kung Fu League and it was actually broadcasted live by China Central Television. So I'm not sure if you can find any footage for this one but I'll try my best to see what I can do about finding some footage for this one because there should have been some footage out there somewhere. But anyway, let's get into the breakdown. So Wu Yanan versus Joseline Edwards. Now this was a fight where both fighters were very aggressive from start to finish. And they had a lot of significant strikes landed throughout the entire fight. And they also attempted quite a few takedowns as well. So let's go ahead and take a look at what happened during round number one. So during round number one, both fighters came out very aggressively from start to finish. They threw quite a bit of strikes back and forth throughout the entire round. They didn't really attempt too many takedowns or anything like that. It was just all striking back and forth. But it was definitely a good round to watch. Both fighters did throw a lot of strikes. Both fighters did land a lot of strikes. And there wasn't much action going on outside of them throwing strikes. So let's move on to round number two. During round number two, again, both fighters came out very aggressively. Again, they threw a lot of strikes back and forth. There weren't really any big takedowns or anything like that. There wasn't even any clinching or anything like that. Just straight up striking back and forth. And again, both fighters landed a lot of strikes. And again, it was another good round to watch. Let's move on to round number three. During round number three, again, both fighters came out very aggressively. Again, they threw a lot of strikes back and forth. Again, there wasn't really any clinch work or anything like that. Again, it was just straight up striking back and forth. And again, both fighters landed a lot of strikes. And again, it was another good round to watch. Let's move on to round number four. During round number four, again, both fighters came out very aggressively. Again, they threw a lot of strikes back and forth. Again, there wasn't really any clinch work or anything like that. Again, it was just straight up striking back and forth. And again, both fighters landed a lot of strikes. And again, it was another good round to watch. Let's move on to round number five. During round number five, again, both fighters came out very aggressively. Again, they threw a lot of strikes back and forth. Again, there wasn't really any clinch work or anything like that. Again, it was just straight up striking back and forth. And again, both fighters landed a lot of strikes. And again, it was another good round to watch. So overall, this was a pretty close fight. I think Wu Yanan probably won three rounds to two. But either way, it was still a pretty close fight. And both fighters did throw a lot of strikes. Both fighters did land a lot of strikes. And there wasn't really any big takedowns or anything like that. It was just all striking back and forth. So overall, it was a pretty good fight.

He's still moving well, but he's not quite as sharp. And I don't know if you can see it here, but when he hits the ball, there's like a little bit of a wobble in his body. It's almost like he's trying to get back into shape after hitting the shot. And that's something we haven't seen from him for a while now. So maybe that's what's going on with him right now. Maybe he's just not feeling completely comfortable yet. But again, this is all stuff that will be fixed over time. So let's move on to some other things that have been happening during these matches. One thing that has been really interesting about Novak is how much more aggressive he's being off the ground. We've talked about this before, but it seems like every match now, no matter who he plays, he's always hitting these aggressive shots off the ground. And one reason why we're seeing this is because his serve isn't working like it used to. When your serve works, you usually try to hit more flat balls so you can get away with them. But when your serve doesn't work, then you need to go up higher and hit more topspin balls. And that's exactly what Novak is doing. Now, another interesting thing that happened recently was that Novak had some issues with his grip tape. Now, I'm sure many people out there probably didn't even know that Novak uses grip tape, but he does. And apparently, in Rome, he lost one of his grips, which caused him to lose control over his racket. And then later on in the tournament, another one came loose, which caused him to miss shots. And then finally, at Monte Carlo, Novak actually broke his racket. So all sorts of things were going wrong...", "event_id": 4}

It's not just to hit the quad, but to hit the glutes as well. And the unilateral action really makes it allow you to focus and really be able to feel all the heads of the muscle that you're trying to work.  We use a very controlled, smooth tempo with this, not locking the knee out completely at the top. Some small tips to help you keep your balance when you're doing it. Control the movement. Don't rush through it. Find a point on the wall and focus on it. and really try and push your chest up when you're doing it. You drop your shoulders forward, hurt your back, hard to keep your balance. So some small tips to help you keep your balance when you're doing it. Push your chest up, don't let your shoulders come forward. Find a point in the wall and focus on it. That'll help you stay balanced. Another thing too is... When you get down there, you want to make sure you're keeping the tension on the leg that's planted on the ground. If you start letting go of that, then you're going to lose tension on the working leg. So always keep tension on both legs. And also, if you can, try and hold the weight for a second or two at the bottom to increase time under tension. That will really help you build more strength and more size in those...", "event_id": 4}

And then also, if you want to get rid of them altogether, you can just unscrew those two bolts and pull them right off. But for me, they work great. They keep my fingers safe. And then another cool feature that they have is the power retainer system. So let me show you how that works. Basically, what happens is when you release the trigger, it releases the arrow. But instead of letting go of the string, which would be a lot more dangerous than letting go of the arrow, it keeps tension on the string until you're ready to fire again. So basically, if you miss your shot, or maybe you need to adjust something on your sight, instead of having to reload every time, all you gotta do is hold onto the trigger, and it will stay tensioned until you're ready to fire again.

And Cherry Tiggo have lost their first game of the season.   And Cherry Tiggo will try again.   And they do manage to score another point.   But it looks like Choco Mucho are going to win this one.

Yeah, it was definitely a lot of fun. You know, the course was set up really well. The jumps were good. There wasn't anything too crazy or anything. But yeah, everyone had a blast. The crowd was huge. They were cheering me on. Everyone was stoked. We got to see some pretty gnarly stuff. So yeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, definitely. Well done, guys. Well done. Thanks, man. Thanks, man.  All right, so we've been riding around all day long. We've seen some amazing tricks. We saw some amazing riders. But what about you? What did you think of your run? My run went okay. I'm happy with how it turned out. I didn't get as many tricks in as I wanted to, but overall, I thought it was okay. And you won! How does that feel? It feels great. It feels so good to win again. It's always nice when you put in work and you pay off at the end. So yeah, feels good. What would you say to the rest of the riders who came out here? Just keep working hard. Keep practicing.

They have to communicate with their crew members all the time. And they do it through hand signals. So if I just show you some of these signals, if you want to go faster, they'll put up three fingers. If you want to slow down, they'll put up one finger. And then there's other ones as well. If you need water or something like that, but they use hand signals because obviously it's very difficult to talk when you're rowing. But what happens sometimes is... The Cox will give a signal and the crew member won't be able to see it properly. They might not be looking in the right direction. Or maybe they don't understand the signal. So sometimes the Cox has to get out of the boat and actually go around the side of the boat and speak directly with the crew member. But yeah, so communication between the Cox and the crew members is really important. It's quite hard to do because you've only got your hands free for about 10 seconds every minute while you're rowing. Yeah, exactly. It's very difficult. And also, when you're racing against another Cox, you know, you've got to make sure your Cox doesn't look over his shoulder at yours and tell him how fast he wants to go. Yeah, exactly. That would be cheating. That wouldn't be good. Exactly. Well, thanks for watching guys. Thanks for listening. Thanks for listening. We hope you enjoyed our video today.

That's all we've been doing for the last two hours. We've been talking about how good Wes Malott is at reading patterns. Well, here goes nothing. Oh, my goodness! What do you say? How good is he? Wow!  The King of Bowling has done it again.   It's over.   Let's take another look at this shot from Wes Malott. He knew exactly what he wanted to do with that ball. Just like that.   And Geico will be disappointed in their performance today. They were able to win one match against Team Lumber Liquidators. But they lost three matches to Team Lumber Liquidators. So they'll have to go back to the drawing board. And they'll have to figure out how to beat these guys next time around. Because they did everything right except for one thing. They didn't bowl well enough. Now let's talk about endless 10th frame. Endless 10th frame is activated by a strike on the fill ball in the tenth frame. Play returns to the top of the order. Team must strike to continue rolling. Only a strike can add additional points. So basically, if you want to keep bowling, you need to make a strike. If you miss your shot, then you lose your turn. And you also lose any points that you would have gotten from that particular frame. So it's pretty much a no -win situation. You either make a strike or you don't. But here comes Wes Malott. He needs to make a strike to activate endless 10th frame. And he does.   And that means they still have a chance at winning this match.   And now they're going to have to figure out who's going to roll next. Do they want to send their best bowler up first? Or do they want to save him for later?   All right, here's Dustin Brown.

He's blocking everything. Right now, if I try to grab him with one hand, it's very difficult because his arm is so strong. And then also, you know, he can just push down on my head or whatever else. But if I have two hands, look at how much more powerful I am. Right? Now, I've got both hands here. Now, I can start to pull him over. Look at how easy it is. It's almost effortless. Okay? So once I get him over, I want to make sure that my elbow stays tight against him. Okay? If I don't keep my elbow tight, he'll be able to turn around and escape. All right? So that's why it's important to have your elbows tight. So again, when I come in here, I'm grabbing his collar. My other hand goes behind his neck. I'm pulling him towards me. Once I get him turned over, I'm keeping my elbow tight. Then from here, I'm going to take my left hand and I'm going to put it behind his shoulder blade. From here, I'm going to bring my knee up into his armpit. That way, now I'm pinching off all the blood flow. So again, we're looking at the choke from the back.

Okay? So instead of getting caught in the smash position, what I need to do is I need to get my hips away from him. As soon as I feel like he's smashing me, I need to move my hips away from him. So I'm moving my hips away from him. Look at how far out I am. Now, I'm going to use my left leg to hook around his thigh. Okay? My left foot is going to hook around his thigh. From here, I'm going to sit back. I'm going to sit back into him. I'm going to grab his belt. I'm going to grab his collar. I'm going to grab his sleeve. I'm going to grab his wrist.

So here's my sit -toe touch test. And as you can see, my toes barely reach the ground. Now if you look at somebody who has good ankle dorsiflexion, their toes will be touching the floor. But even so, this isn't going to get us very far with our deadlift. Now let me show you why. If I put my hands behind me like this, then I'm not able to sit back far enough into my hip joint. And therefore, when I go to lift off the floor, I'll end up having to use more knee flexion than I'd like. So now let's take a look at somebody who does have better ankle dorsiflexion.

And then as soon as you come off the apex, you want to be getting your power back in so you don't lose any time at all. And then we're onto the long straight again. Again, very similar to what we did before. We're trying to keep it nice and smooth through these corners. You know, if you lock up or anything, you'll really struggle through them.

That was about 20 yards further than my seven iron so that's great. So if we go back to what we were talking about earlier about how they've designed these clubs and how adjustable they are. If we look down here at the bottom of the club head, we can see that there's actually two screws in there which means you can move the weight around. You can put it towards the toe or towards the heel depending on where you want your ball flight to go. And then up top here, you'll notice that there's another little slot. That allows us to change the loft slightly. So again, really easy to do. Really simple. And again, it gives you some options as to whether you want to hit it higher or lower.

So I'm going to try and hit it up into the air with a little bit more loft than normal so we can get it over the green. And if it lands short, well, that's okay. We'll have another go at it from there. But let's see how he does here.  So he's got his 58 degree wedge out again. He's using his lob wedge today. He's not using his pitching wedge. That's why he's hitting it so high. It's got a lot of loft on it. It's going to come down pretty hard. Let's see how he gets on.  Right guys, so we've had a great day out here at La Finca Golf Resort. We've played some great golf. We've met some amazing people. We've seen some amazing shots.

It's so much fun to ride this track because you're always going up or down and there's always something new coming at you. So I mean, it's really hard not to have fun riding this thing. It's got some nice little features in here that make you want to go fast. And then when you get into the trees, it gets a bit more technical with all these roots and stuff like that. But yeah, overall, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's definitely one of my favorite tracks out here.  So we've been doing a lot of work on this track over the last couple of years. We started off with a few jumps and some rollers and things like that. And now we've added in a bunch of different features like the tabletops and stuff like that. We've also built a few wooden bridges as well. The whole idea behind this track was to build something that would be accessible for everyone. But yet still have enough variety for people who wanted to do tricks and jump big jumps. There's a lot of different lines through the track. Some riders will take one line and other riders will take another line. So if they don't feel comfortable doing certain tricks, they can choose to go around them. Or if they want to try them, they can give it a shot.   One of the most important parts about building a track is making sure there's no sharp turns. Because once you start getting into those sharp turns, people tend to crash. So we tried to keep everything nice and smooth throughout the track.  When you come down from the top of the hill, you hit your first feature which is a small step up. Then after that you'll hit a double drop right here. Then you'll hit two smaller drops. After that you'll hit a tabletop. You'll hit a double drop again. Then you'll hit a bridge. After that you'll hit another bridge. Then you'll hit a step up. Then you'll hit a roller.

Now, if you've been watching my channel for any length of time, you probably already know that I'm not really big into the field tip thing. It just seems kind of silly to me because... If you're shooting a crossbow, you should have a broadhead or something else on there. But let's see how accurate this bow is out of the box with a field tip. Let's take a look at these shots. All right, so as far as accuracy goes, not bad. Not bad at all. They were all within about an inch of each other. That was pretty good. Now, keep in mind, these are only five pound arrows. So when you add a broad head onto them, they're going to weigh more than five pounds. And so accuracy may vary depending upon what type of broad head you use. But overall, pretty good groupings.

So we're just going to start off with some side bends. We want to make sure our feet are hip width apart. We don't want them too close together or too far away because it's not going to be effective for us. And then from there, I've got my hands up in the air so I can see where my hips are moving. So if they go out to one side, I know that my hands have gone out to the other side. And what we're trying to do here is keep our shoulders nice and square and try and get those hips all the way over to the side. Now this next movement is called a figure four. What we're doing is keeping one leg straight and bending the knee of the opposite leg. So I'm bending my right knee and pushing my left hip back. What we're looking for here is making sure that we're getting a good stretch through the hamstrings but also keeping our chest open. Now when we come into this position, we need to make sure that we're not rounding at the back. So we really want to think about pushing our bum down towards the floor and keeping our chest open. The next exercise here is called a figure eight. So again, what we're doing is keeping one leg straight and bending the opposite knee. But now instead of just leaning forward, we're actually going to bring our arms around in front of us like a figure eight shape. Again, we want to make sure that we're keeping our chest open as much as possible. But we're also working on our balance by having to move around while still trying to maintain that position. The last exercise here is called a windmill. So once again, we're keeping one leg straight and bending the opposite knee. This time though, we're bringing our arms behind us and rotating through our torso. Once again, we want to make sure that we're keeping our chest open but also maintaining balance throughout the whole movement. If you find any of these exercises difficult, you can always hold onto something like a wall or even have someone standing beside you to give you support.

So I had to pull over into the shoulder. And as soon as he passed me, I went back to my lane. And then he started to get mad at me for pulling over. So he started honking his horn. And then he turned around and drove away from me. Which made no sense because if he really wanted to pass me, why would he drive away? He should have kept driving towards me.

Once we reached Mount Lemmon, we took a quick stop at the top before heading back down. The total distance traveled was 60 miles with an elevation gain of about 3 ,000 feet.

Today we're going to be talking about how I got into surfing. So let me just get out here in this water for you guys so that way it doesn't look like I'm talking to myself. So yeah, so basically when I was little, my dad used to take us down to the beach every day after school and he'd have his surfboard with him. And he'd always say, hey, come over here, let's go surfing. And then he'd paddle around on his board while we were playing in the sand or whatever. But as soon as there was a wave coming through, he would jump off his board and catch it. And I think that's what really got me interested because it looked fun. It looked cool. It looked exciting. And at the time, you know, I didn't even realize that there was such a thing called professional surfing. I thought everyone did it for fun. But yeah, my dad kind of just... He'd do it all the time. He'd wake up early in the morning before work and go out and catch some waves before he went into work. And then after work, he'd come straight back down to the beach again and catch more waves. And then sometimes if the waves were good enough, we'd actually stay overnight at the beach and sleep under our car. And then the next day, we'd wake up early again and catch some more waves. And then once we started getting older, my brother and I started learning how to surf. My dad had a couple of friends who were pretty good surfers. They taught us how to stand up on boards and ride them. And then from there, we just kept doing it. We kept going out and catching waves together. We'd go out and surf every single day. Sometimes twice a day. If the conditions were right. And as soon as we could start riding bigger waves, we'd try and find some bigger waves. And then eventually when we were old enough, we started competing against each other. And then eventually, we ended up competing against each other in competitions. And then one day, one of my friends said, hey, why don't you enter the Australian Junior Tour? And I was like, oh, okay. That sounds interesting. So I entered the Australian Junior Tour. And then I won the first event. And then I won the second event. And then I won the third event. And then I won the fourth event. And then I won the fifth event. And then I won the sixth event.

I just wanted to give you a quick tour around this skatepark because it's one of my favorite ones that we have out here in LA. It has some really cool stuff and there's not too many people here today so let me show you what it looks like. So first off, we're going to start over here with the street section. So right when you walk into this area, you've got these two banks. You can see they're pretty big. They're about 10 feet tall. They're kind of like a quarter pipe but they're more of a bank. And then you've got this little hip right next to them which is pretty fun for doing tricks. And then if you come down to the bottom, you've got these three ledges. The first ledge is about four foot high. The second ledge is about six foot high. And then the third ledge is about eight foot tall. And then from there, you've got this big bowl. There's actually another bowl behind us as well. But this bowl is pretty fun. It's got a lot of different features. There's a couple different sections. One thing I love about this area is how smooth everything is. Everything flows together really nicely. And then once you get back over here, you've got this little mini ramp. This is probably one of my favorite things at this skatepark. It's super small. It's only about five or six feet wide. But because it's so short, it makes it really easy to do tricks on it. And then after you hit the top of the mini ramp, you've got another little hip. which is also pretty fun for doing tricks. And then from there, you've got some rails. You've got two flat bars. One on each side of the mini ramp. And then you've got this rail right here. Which is pretty long. And then from there, you've got this other little hip. And then you've got this bank right here. Which is also pretty fun for doing tricks. And then from there, you've got this ramp. Which is pretty cool. It's got a nice transition. And then once you land it, you've got this ledge right here. And then from there, you've got this bowl. Which is actually pretty deep. It's got a lot of different sections. A lot of different things to grind on. And then from there, you've got this little halfpipe. Which is pretty fun. And then from there, you've got this little hip. And then from there, you've got this bowl.

We'll do 30 seconds of rowing, then we'll go into a squat to stand for 30 seconds. So you can use your hands if you need them or you can hold onto something for balance as well. Then we'll go into a hollow hold for 30 seconds. So tuck those hips under and squeeze that belly button in towards your spine. And then finally single leg glute bridges for 30 seconds each side. And then we have our barbell warm up. We'll do five good mornings, five back squats, five elbow rotations, five strict press and reach, five Romanian deadlifts, and five front squats. And then we'll finish off with some mobility. Barbell ankle stretch, wall turn back stretch. Today's workout is called Never Forget. It's three rounds. Each round will be four minutes long. You've got one minute to set up before starting the timer. The first movement is dumbbell thrusters. You want to make sure that when you pick your dumbbells out, they're at least at shoulder height so you don't have to bend over too much. From there, it's just like a front rack position. Keep your feet about hip width apart. Your elbows should track over top of your hands throughout this movement. The goal here is to get those dumbbells overhead in full extension.

Close the left eye, only one eye is in focus. That's why I think it's so important for you guys who are shooting with your non-dominant eye, whether you're right -handed or left -handered, to make sure that your eye is focused on the target and not focused on the string crawl. Because once you start focusing on the string crawl, then you lose sight of the target.

So he qualified 11th and then went into moto one where he started off quite well. He got up to third place but unfortunately had some problems with his bike which caused him to lose all power and he ended up finishing fourth overall. And now we're going to go straight into the highlights from moto two where Cairoli actually won. So here we have him coming around turn number one. This is when he took the lead from Jeffrey Herlings. And this is when he passed him again on the inside line. And then he just kept pulling away afterwards. And here he's just about to take third place from Romain Febvre. And then he goes through to second place. But then he gets passed by Jeffrey Herlings who takes over second place.

A couple of weeks ago, he was talking about how he felt like he could win every single event on tour. Well, he's still feeling pretty good about himself. He's sitting in third place after round number one. With a score of 90 .75.   Casper, man, he's so smooth.  He's such a smooth bull. You don't see many bigger bulls out there like that.

So if you're getting lower back pain in your squat, it could be due to a number of reasons. It could be tightness or weaknesses in the glutes, hamstrings, quads, hip flexors, etc. So I'm going to show you some stretches for those areas as well. And then also some exercises that will help strengthen those areas so that they can support your spine better. But before we get into all of this, make sure you hit the like button below and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already done so.

All right, so here's a quick little tip if you want to stretch your lats or your back muscles. Just take a band, wrap it around something high, grab one end, pull it across your body, lean into it, and then lean forward. That will give you a nice little stretch through those lats. You can also grab both ends and pull yourself across your body. That gives you a nice stretch through your hamstrings too. If you don't have a band, you could use a towel or even a rope. Anything that has enough length to where you can reach from one side of your body to the other side would work. And then another thing you can do is grab both ends of the band and put it behind your neck. And then that will give you a nice stretch through your hips.

And now we're just going to do like a little bit more advanced stuff from this position. Okay? So let's say you guys have been doing this for a while. You've got your guys down. They know how to defend it. They're not giving you that foot. Okay? So what am I going to do if they don't give me that foot? Well, one thing I could do is I could grab their belt. I could come over top here. And then I could start to pull them back into me. Another option would be if he doesn't want to give me his belt or whatever. He's really good at defending his legs. He's keeping his feet away from me. What I might try to do is I'll take him out of balance. I'll put pressure on his head. I'll push his head towards the mat. Now when I push his head towards the mat, I'm going to use my other hand and I'm going to reach underneath him. And I'm going to bring him right back onto me. All right? Now once I'm in this position, I still have control of his arm. If I need to, I can start working some kind of armbar or something else with my left leg. But again, I'm trying to keep control of his arm so I can bring him back around.  Once I'm here, now I can work some different things. Maybe I can even work a triangle choke.  One last thing I wanted to show you was from this position where he has both hands free. Let's say he's able to get his arms free.   Alright, so maybe he gets his arms free. What I'm gonna try to do is I'm gonna try to take his legs away from me. Alright, so let's say he's able to get his hands free. I'm gonna try to take his legs away from me. So I'm gonna grab his wrist. I'm gonna grab his wrist with my thumb facing upwards. Then I'm gonna step over his knee. Step over his knee.  And then I'm gonna sit down.  From here, I'm gonna grab his ankle. I'm gonna grab his ankle. And I'm gonna pull him across my body.  That way I can set up different submissions. Or I can just hold him there until he gives me his leg. So again, we're here. We're here. He's able to get his hands free. He's able to get his hands free. I'm grabbing his wrist.

Now, how do we clean up the floor? Well, let's just say we had a towel handy. We could use a towel. But most likely, what you would probably find is something called a broom. A broom looks like this. It has a handle with a bunch of bristles at the end. And so when you spill water, the best thing to do is sweep it into one spot. That way you can pick it up easily.

They can assess what needs to be done. And then we will see them out tomorrow for leg 10. We've got a little bit more time before we start racing again.

Today's tip number three is keep your racket vertical throughout the contact area. So what I mean by that is when you're coming into the ball, if you have a flat swing or even a slice swing, it doesn't really matter, but you want to make sure that as soon as you hit the ball, your racquet stays vertical throughout the entire contact area so you can get the most spin out of the ball possible. If you look at this racket right now, my racquet is not vertical. It's kind of leaning forward just a little bit. So once I come in, I'm going to try to keep it straight up and down through the entire contact area. And then after I hit the ball, it will naturally go back down because gravity wants to pull my arm down. But if I stay straight up and down here, I'll be able to generate more spin off the ball. If I start getting too much forward lean like this, then I won't be able to generate much spin off the ball....", "event_id": 12}

It's about 12 minutes or so. And I'm going to show you guys how to do each one of these movements. We have handstand push -ups, strict toes to bar, and strict ring dips. So first up, handstand push -up. We want to make sure that our hands are right underneath our shoulders. Our feet come together in a nice straight line. We don't let them flare out like this. And then as we lower down, we keep those elbows tucked into our sides. So they're not flaring out like this. They're staying close to your body. And then when you press back up, you can see her head stays right over top of her hands. She doesn't look forward at all. She looks straight ahead. Next movement is going to be a strict toe touch. So she's going to get into a hollow position here with her hips high. Her knees are locked out. Her arms are fully extended. And then from there, she's going to bring her knees towards her chest while keeping her arms fully extended. And then once she gets back into that hollow position, she'll repeat for reps. Then lastly, we got the strict ring dip. So she's going to start by getting into a full extension position where her legs are fully extended. Then she lowers herself down until her elbow reaches full lockout. And then she presses back up until her arms reach full extension again. Now if you notice, when she goes down, her elbows aren't coming out to the side. They stay tight against her body. And then when she comes back up, she keeps her shoulders pulled back and down. That way she maintains that neutral spine throughout the whole movement. All right, now we're gonna move on to the workout itself. So we've got three rounds of nine repetitions per exercise. So first round will be nine handstand push-ups, nine strict toes to bars, and nine strict ring dips. Second round will be eight reps of each exercise, third round will be seven reps of each exercise, fourth round will be six reps of each exercise, fifth round will be five reps of each exercise, sixth round will be four reps of each exercise, seventh round will be three reps of each exercise, eighth round will be two reps of each exercise, ninth round will be one rep of each exercise. All right, so we're starting off with the handstand push -ups here. You can see how she's maintaining that nice straight line between her head and heels.

And I'm not saying that this is going to be for everyone. It's definitely not going to be for everyone. But if you're looking to get into gravel riding or just want to try something new, this could be a great way of doing so. So what was the event like? Well, it started off in the morning with a 10 -mile time trial on road bikes. And then after that, there were two gravel races. The first one was a 20-mile race around a single track loop. The second one was a shorter 10-mile race around a more open trail. Both had some pretty technical sections as well. After those, there was a longer gravel race which went up the mountain and back down again. That was about 30 miles long in total. And finally, there was a shorter version of that same route. That was only about 15 miles long. Now, all of these races were timed. So if you finished within the time limit, you would get a medal. If you didn't finish within the time limit, you wouldn't get anything at all. But overall, I thought it was a really good day out. It was quite challenging but also fun. There wasn't too much rain either. We did get rained on a little bit but nothing too bad. If you'd like to see any more videos like this, please let me know by leaving me a comment below.

So now we're going to look at the brake hand up top. And this time we're going to do it with a top rope climb. So again, we've got our leading hand and then our brake hand. And this time we're going to have the brake hand above us. So again, just like before, you want to make sure your hands are nice and close together. The leading hand's going to go on top. The brake hand's going to go underneath. Now what you need to remember is when you pull down with your leading hand, your brake hand needs to come up as well. If you don't bring your brake hand up, all you're doing is pulling yourself away from the wall. You're not actually doing anything useful for climbing. So if you notice here, every single time my leading hand goes down, my brake hand comes up. That way I'm always pulling myself towards the wall. Now there's one other thing that happens sometimes. Sometimes people will get into a situation where they have their hands too far apart. They might even find themselves in a position where they're actually pushing against each other. If you ever find yourself in that position, just move your brake hand back onto the rope so that you're back in control. Okay, so let's take a quick look at how to use the brake hand below you. This time we're going to do it with a top rope descent. Again, same rules apply. We've got our leading hand and our brake hand. We've got them nice and close together. But this time the brake hand's going to stay on the bottom. What you need to remember now is anytime you move your leading hand away from the rope, your brake hand has to come along with it. That way you're always keeping tension on the rope. If you don't keep tension on the rope, then you're going to fall off the end of the rope. So watch how my brake hand follows...", "event_id": 8}

They scored four goals within the first five minutes to get out to a quick lead. And then they were able to hold that lead throughout most of the game until the final minute when Virginia was able to tie it up. But Hopkins would come right back and win the game in overtime. Johns Hopkins had a lot of great individual performances from their players today. One of them being Ryan Brown who had six goals and two assists. He also won nine face-offs which helped him get those extra touches on offense. Another player that stood out was Ryan Creighton who had three goals and two assists as well.

So she's going to go ahead and push off the ground. So you can see how far she was able to move the barbell just by pushing off the ground. Now if you were to take your feet out of the equation completely, how far would you be able to move the bar? Not very far at all. So when we talk about getting more leg drive into this lift, we need to make sure that we understand where our hips should be positioned at any given time during a lift. So let me show you guys an example of what not to do first. So she's going to set up like normal for a bench press. She's going to keep her butt down on the pad the whole entire time. And then she's going to push off the ground. Now watch how high her hips come up because there's no room underneath for them to actually drive through. Go ahead and give us one more rep. See how high those hips came up? That's exactly why people struggle so hard with their bench presses. They don't know where they're supposed to be driving from.

You say, well, if this bull gets out in front of me, what am I going to do? And then he does exactly what we were talking about earlier. He goes up over top of him. That's not something that you want to do because if you don't have enough speed to come back around, then you can be in trouble. But he had enough speed coming into that corner. He knew he could make the turn. But when he did, he went straight at him with his head. And when he did, he put enough pressure on him where he couldn't move.

We have two different types of bullets here. We have some Sierra Match King bullets. And as you can see, they did not do very well. They were all over the place. They didn't even hit the paper. One went through the paper. One was right here. The other ones were way off to the side. So if we measure those up... You know, they're probably about four or five inches wide. And then when you come down here, you can see how far off target they actually went. So that's definitely something to keep in mind. If you want to use these bullets, make sure your gun is sighted in properly. Now moving on to the XTP bullets, which are much more accurate than the match kings, you can see that my first shot group was only about two inches across. That's really nice.

She lost to two really good horses. One was the horse who ended up winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. The other one was a horse named Sweetest Thing. And then she came back and beat Sweetest Thing again. So we knew right away that she was going to be something pretty special.

And I'm sure they'll take that into consideration when they get their free dance marks later tonight. Well, let's see what we have here. We've got the scores from the judges. We've got Shaikin Saksinsky and Svetlana Kuznetsova. They were second after the short program. They had 63 .8 points. Their free dance was 65 .8. So they scored 131 .6. That puts them into third place right now. That's a great position for them because it means they can skate their free dance without any pressure whatsoever. They don't need to win this championship. But if they do well enough, then they will go to the World Championships next month. And then they'll be able to compete against all the other teams around the world. It's a good position to be in. And you know, when you look at the competition, there's some really good pairs out there. There's some new ones coming up. The Russians are doing very well. The Americans are doing very well. So there's no reason why these two shouldn't be able to compete with anybody else. Let's see how they did. Compositional mark was 5 .5. Artistic expression was 5 .5. Originality was 5 .5.

So what we're doing today is we've got two different types of trails here at Hillside. We have the blue trail which is more of your standard flowy single track with jumps and stuff like that. And then we also have the red trail which has some really steep climbs and drops and stuff like that. So it's quite a mix between both. But yeah, we're just going to go out there and ride around for a bit. Let's do this!  Alright guys, so first thing first, let me introduce myself. My name is Jasper. I'm 22 years old. I live in Leeds, UK. And as you can see from my helmet, I am sponsored by Mavic. And they make really good helmets. As well as that, I wear this Mavic jacket. It keeps me warm when it gets cold outside. And these gloves keep my hands warm too. Also, if you look down here, you might notice something on my wrist. That's because I'm wearing these Garmin Edge devices. They help me track how many miles I ride every day. They also give me information about my heart rate while I'm riding. It helps me stay fit while I'm mountain biking. If you want one yourself, there will be links below where you can get yours. Now, as far as bikes go, I don't actually own any bikes. I rent all mine from a local bike shop called Bike Park Bike Hire. The reason why I do this is because I travel around quite a lot and I need different types of bikes depending on what type of terrain I'm going to ride on. For example, if I was going to ride on downhill tracks or big jumps, I would use something like a downhill bike. However, since most of the time I ride on single track trails, I usually use a cross country bike. The bike I'm using right now is a Scott Genius. It's a great bike. It's lightweight, it's fast, but it still has enough suspension to handle rougher terrain. Overall, it's a very versatile bike and I love it. If you'd like to check out more videos featuring me riding on this bike, then click on the link above or below. Anyway, without further ado, let's get into the video. Oh, and before I forget, don't forget to subscribe because I upload new videos every week. And if you haven't already done so, please follow me on Instagram at @JasperMTV. Okay, enough talking.

But you can't let the runner tag up for the second. And then when you do get the ball back from the outfielder, throw the ball right into second base. Stop the double play. Keep the double play going. Stop the runner getting to second base. Because those things matter in the one -run games. And they're going to happen more often than not during these playoffs.

Navarro had never beaten a top ten player before this year but he'd already done so once this week when he beat Rafael Nadal in straight sets.

These felt pretty good. They were actually really easy. It's been a while since I've done these. But yeah, they went up pretty easily. And you can see that I am wearing knee sleeves on both sides there. That's because I have an ACL brace on one side. And so it makes it hard to put... knee sleeves over top of it without them getting all messed up or anything like that. So I had to wear two different ones. But anyway, these felt great. And then I moved up to 365 for another set of eight reps. These also felt very easy. So I decided to go ahead and move up again. To 385 for six reps. And these felt really good too.

Yeah, that's right. Well, he did have some good results earlier in the year. He won the Tour de Romandie back in April. He also took second place at the Tour de France behind Alberto Contador. But as we've seen today, he hasn't been able to replicate those results here in London. No, well, you know, obviously there's always expectations coming from yourself or your team or whatever. And sometimes they don't come together. Sometimes things go wrong. That's why you train so hard for these big events. So we'll try again tomorrow. We'll see what happens.  The Dutchman has had a busy season, but hasn't managed to win any races yet. However, he does hope to change that soon.  Yeah, well, obviously there's still plenty of time left this year.

Rabobank rider Lars Boom won the yellow jersey by winning two stages during the tour. He said he hoped to defend his title next year.   I'm very proud because last year I was lucky enough to wear the yellow jersey and now again I could wear it so I'm very proud about that. Of course I will try next year to keep the jersey because it's nice to wear it twice.   I think it's important for me to stay focused and to ride everyday training sessions and then hopefully everything will work out fine.   For more news and information visit www .tourofbritain .com.

And I'm sure that's exactly what he did here tonight. He didn't let it get to him. He stayed in the moment. And now he has taken over the lead in the round. Well done by Paulo Lima. Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's so easy to let those emotions take over. But if you stay focused on what you need to do, it'll work out well. And that's exactly what happened here. Shaken, who had been bucked off three times before tonight, gets the job done here against Paulo Lima. Yeah, and this is a great example of how important it is to have good bulls like Shaken. This is a good bull. He's not super fast or super powerful, but he does everything right. He jumps up high, turns around, throws his head down, does everything right. And when you've got a guy who's got as much talent as Paulo Lima, he's able to take advantage of it. Cooper Davis has won two events so far this season. He's looking for number three. Heavy D coming after him. Davis staying busy.   Oh, man! What a ride from Cooper Davis.  Wow, Cooper Davis just took care of business there. That's why we love watching him ride. He doesn't give up. He keeps fighting. He keeps working at it. And sometimes you don't even see what he's doing until afterwards. Because he's always moving his feet. He's always moving his hips. He never gives up. And that's why he's such a great rider. And Heavy D, well, he's a big guy. He's a big strong bull. And he's got some big moves too. So Cooper Davis had to keep moving around. And he kept making adjustments to try to find where he could make himself comfortable. And then finally, he found it. And he made it happen. And that's why we love watching him ride. 86 .5 points for Cooper Davis. He takes over the lead in the event.   We talked earlier about Dakota Louis' chance to win this round. Here he goes against Crazy Doc.  Crazy Doc trying to go crazy with Dakota Louis.  Oh, man!   Dakota Lewis takes the win.  The crowd loves it. They want more.

It'll look something like this. Okay? Yeah, so... Let's go ahead and get started with the first trick. The first trick we're gonna learn today is called a backflip. Alright, so backflips are pretty easy once you've got your front flips down. All you gotta do is jump off the ledge instead of jumping forward. So for example, let's say I was doing my front flip here. If I were to do a backflip, instead of jumping forward, I would jump backwards.  Like that. That's how you do a backflip. Now, there's different ways to do them. You could either do a tuck, which means your knees come into your chest. Or you could do a full extension, where your legs stay straight out in front of you. Personally, I prefer doing a tuck because it makes me feel more comfortable. But whatever works best for you. Just make sure you practice both ways until you find out which one you like better. Next trick we're learning today is called a 360. A 360 is basically a backflip except with a twist at the end. So after you do your backflip, you want to turn around and face the direction you came from. So basically, you're going to be facing away from the ledge. And then you're going to step onto the ledge again. And then you're going to repeat the same thing as before. Jump off the ledge. Do a backflip. Turn around....", "event_id": 8}

Today we're going to talk about the difference between a jab and a cross. The first thing you want to do when you throw your jab or cross is make sure that your shoulders are square to your opponent. If they have their hands up, make sure you don't get too close and let them catch it with their hands. You always want to be able to land clean shots. When you throw your jab, you can either use it as a lead-up shot for another punch or just throw it straight out there. Your cross should come from your hip. It's not just coming from your arm. It comes from your hips. So if I was throwing my left hand across, my left shoulder would go down and then back up again. That way I could generate more power behind my punches. And also, if he has his hands down, he won't see me coming. A lot of people think that the jab is only used for distance control.

Just enough so that my body has to work harder. But again, not too heavy where you're really struggling with the lift. Then we go up to 500 pounds for one rep. Again, no problem at all.

So let me just get right into it. I hope you enjoy this video. If you do, please give it a thumbs up. And if you're new here, hit that subscribe button down below for more videos like these in the future. And without further ado, let's go ahead and jump right into today's video. So before we start off with the actual workout itself, I want to talk about what exactly I did prior to actually starting off with the workout. So first things first, obviously warm up your body. Get some blood flowing through those muscles so they can prepare for the upcoming workout. Secondly, you want to perform three sets of 10 reps each on incline bench press. Now obviously this isn't really a warm-up set because you're not using any heavy weight but rather just getting used to the movement and making sure everything feels good. Now after that you want to move on to doing three sets of eight reps at around 70 % of your one rep max. Now as far as rest goes between all these sets, it should be anywhere between two minutes to four minutes depending on how much weight you have on the barbell. The heavier the weights, the longer the rest time needs to be because you need to make sure your muscles recover enough so you don't risk injury or injury from lifting too heavy. But anyways, moving on to the next exercise which is flat dumbbell presses. For this particular exercise, I decided to use a spotter because I felt like I was pushing myself pretty hard with the amount of weight I had on the barbells. But anyways, I performed five sets of six reps at around 80% of my one rep max. Rest times were also around two minutes to four minutes again depending on how much weight you have on the barbells. Afterwards, I moved on to doing three sets of eight reps at around 70%. So now moving on to the third and final superset of the day, which consists of dumbbell flyes and tricep pushdowns. For both of these exercises, I performed three sets of ten reps each. Rest times were also around two minutes to four minutes depending on how much weight you have on the barbells. And last but not least, we got triceps. So for this particular day, I chose to focus on doing skull crushers as well as overhead extensions. So for both these exercises, I performed four sets of eight reps each. Rest times were also around two minutes to four minutes depending on how much weight you have on the barbells. After finishing up with all these exercises, I finished off the rest of my workout by doing some cardio. So I ended up doing about 20 minutes worth of cardio on the elliptical machine. And yeah, that's basically all there is to say about this particular workout. If you enjoyed today's video, please leave a thumbs up.

But now we're coming into a new area where we need some more cover. And so what we do is we look up at the windows again. and we find one that's open like this one right here. Now if you look down below me, there's actually a doorframe right here. That would be good cover too because they'd have to shoot through two walls to hit us. But what we want to do is use this window as cover. Now when we move forward, we're still looking for targets. We're keeping our head up high so we can see everything.

We've got about three inches left to move the crosshairs over. And so it should be pretty easy to get her back where she needs to be. So anyway, just wanted to show you guys how these things work. These are all pretty much on paper. They're just off of my target. That one was probably about two inches low.  Maybe even closer than that. And those were all shot from rest. So they weren't really...  The gun wasn't really moving around too bad. It was just me shooting. So anyway, there you go. That's how they work. Hope you enjoyed the video.

You want to make sure that your boat gets out of the way as quickly as possible and then you just need to focus on getting yourself ready for the next part of the race. So I'm going to show you some examples now from our junior men's eight at Tasman Rowing Club. So this first one here... We've got a little bit of a problem with the bow man there. He's not quite ready yet. He's still rowing his stroke. And so he needs to wait until he's finished rowing before he starts moving forward.

It's always great to have a look at these young horses and see what they're all about. They're only two years old. They're only babies. But you can tell straight away which ones are going to go on to do something special. Yeah, absolutely. And it's interesting too when you see them now compared with the three-year-olds later today. You know, there's quite a few three-year-olds who were babies last year. So you get to see their development over 12 months. And yeah, it's amazing how much they change over that time. Yeah, absolutely. It's incredible. The way they grow up. And then obviously they start training from quite early age. So... yeah i mean i don't want to say early but um from four or five months old they're starting to do things um so yeah there's lots happening with these foals but uh this one looks pretty good doesn't she yeah very relaxed uh lovely walk nice and straight and just looking forward to seeing more of her later on yeah well done time to fly   Well, let's hope she does fly soon. That'd be nice wouldn't it?   Okay, so let's move on to our next horse. This is Tamarind.  Tamarind by Cassini II.   By Cassini II. He was a great horse. He won lots of Grand Prix.   And he's had a lot of success himself.   Yes, he did.   And he's also produced a lot of really successful eventers.  So hopefully he's passed on his talents to Tamarind.   And she's doing pretty well.  Very confidently trotting around here.   And again, looking forward to seeing her in the future.   Yeah, definitely.   All right, so next up we've got another chestnut filly. This is Bella.  by Duke of York.   Now Duke of York is a very popular stud. He's produced some really good eventers himself.  And hopefully Bella will follow in those footsteps.   Let's see if she can follow in those footsteps.   Right, so our winner of the Futurity Event Filly Foal Championship for 2018 is Time to Fly.

She's won World Championships. She's won Olympic medals. She's done all kinds of cool stuff. But how does she feel about her career? What has she learned from it? How much fun has she had? Is she enjoying herself? Because if she's not enjoying herself, why is she doing it anymore?   Exactly.   I mean, you know, if you want to shoot at the Olympics, there's only so many ways you can do it. You either have to win a world championship or be top five in the Olympic qualifying series. And then you qualify for the Olympics. But other than that, like, why are you doing it? Like, is it fun? Is it fun? Because archery is supposed to be fun. If you're not having fun, why are you doing it?   There we go.   Now we need to make sure they're even.   They look pretty good.   I'm going to try to get my arrow back up here.

So the first thing was obviously swimming. We had a pretty good start. We were able to stay with a group of guys who were pretty fast. It wasn't too bad. The water temperature was about 75 degrees, so that felt great. But as soon as we hit the transition area, things started to fall apart.  There was a lot of people in transition. It took us about five minutes to find our bikes.  Once we found them, we put them together, but they weren't labeled correctly. So we spent another couple minutes trying to figure out which one was ours. Then we finally got everything set up and headed back out onto the course. By now, everyone else has already gone by us, so we lost quite a bit of time. But at least we didn't lose too much ground. And then when we came around on the second lap, we caught up to a bunch of guys again. And we rode with those guys for a little while until they dropped off. And then after that, we ended up riding alone with a few other guys. And then eventually we caught up to a big group of guys. And we stayed with them until the end of the ride.  Overall, though, it was a pretty good day. The bike split was okay. Not my best ever, but still pretty decent.  Now let's move on to the run. As soon as we crossed over into T2, we saw...", "event_id": 2}

It's very hard for him to hold onto this because he doesn't have any grip strength. If I pull back, look how easy it is for me to take this leg away. See how easy that was? Boom! Right into the guillotine. That's why I always say, don't ever let go of the choke until you know where you're going with your legs.

We hit our subscriber goal. We reached over 1 ,000 subscribers. Thank you all very much. That was pretty quick. I think it took us less than three months or something like that.

All right, now let's talk about these brakes. These are hydraulic disc brakes from Shimano. They come stock on the Trek Roxton. The front brake comes with a 180mm rotor, which is pretty big. The rear comes with a 160mm rotor. Now, this is not the best setup for downhill riding because you need more power in the rear. But overall, it works great for trail riding.

But as soon as I start moving away from her, that's when she loses her balance. And then all I have to do is lift her up like this. Okay? One more time.  All right. Now let's talk about the other side. Same thing. She has me in this position. But now instead of lifting me up, what she wants to do is throw me down. So again, same thing. As soon as I move away from her, she loses her balance. And then all I have to do is grab underneath her leg. and pull her towards me. Okay? So once again, as soon as I move away, she loses her balance. Grab under her leg, pull her towards me. As long as I keep pulling on her leg, she won't be able to stand up. Pulling on her leg will make it so she doesn't fall over onto her face. If I don't hold on to her leg, she might end up falling onto her face. So I've got to keep holding on to her leg until she gets back up on her feet. Then I can release her leg and take care of whatever else needs to happen. Okay? Let's try that one more time.

So we're going to go ahead and adjust this lever to where you can actually feel the brake pad contact before you get any resistance. And then what we'll do is we'll take our bike up a little bit of a hill here and see how well they stop us from rolling down that hill. We've got about 10 miles per hour of speed right now. And so let's give them a try. See if they work out all right for us. All right, so we have adjusted the lever tensioner here so that when you pull in the lever, there's no resistance at all until you start feeling that brake pad contact. We also went ahead and adjusted the reach adjustment on the lever as well. So now we should have a nice comfortable lever position for ourselves. Let's go ahead and test these things out. See how they work. All right, so first impressions are really positive. They seem like they're stopping me very well. The only thing I would say is... They don't quite have the same feel or feedback as my old SRAM level T levers did. But again, those were hydraulic levers. These are mechanical. So it makes sense that they wouldn't have exactly the same feedback. But overall, they seem like they're doing their job pretty well. Now, one thing I will note about these brakes is that when you come to a complete stop, you need to hold your hand down on the lever because otherwise, the caliper will retract back into its original position. It doesn't stay engaged in its locked position. That might not be such a big deal if you're riding around town, but definitely something worth noting. Overall, though, I'd say this is probably one of the best value brakes that you could buy right now. It's definitely not top -tier stuff by any means, but considering the price point, $100 for both front and rear, I mean, that's a steal.

Now what do we want? We don't want him to be able to just stand right away. We need to make sure that when we go into this position, that our foot stays on top of his ankle. If your foot comes off his ankle, he's going to stand up immediately. But if you keep your foot here, he has no choice but to stay down. And so now as soon as I feel like I've got enough space, I'm going to grab my shin with both hands. And again, this is really important. You don't want to let go of your foot until you've got your hand on your shin. Because if you let go too early, you might lose your balance. So once I've got both hands on my shin, then I can let go of my foot. And now I'm ready to start attacking.  Okay, so one more time.   So I'm here. My opponent's trying to defend against me.

It's got some nice power behind it. Yeah, we'll see how it does in the field. All right, let's go ahead and get started. All right, so here we have our first test shot. We've got a 2 .5 gram CO2 tank hooked up to our CS1 paintball marker. We're shooting at about 100 feet away from us. And as you can see, we're getting around about 250 to 260 FPS with these shots. So that's not too bad for a paintball marker using CO2. Now, if you guys want to know more information about what kind of FPS you should expect out of your marker, make sure to check out my video on how to calculate your FPS. And also, if you guys want to learn more about how to tune your marker, make sure to check out my video on tuning your paintball marker. Now, after shooting three pods through this marker, we were able to get an average FPS of 255 and a max FPS of 260. So again, not too shabby considering what type of marker we're working with. Now, after shooting those three pods, we decided to shoot four more just to see how much power we could actually get out of this marker. And as you can see, we were still getting around that same average FPS of 255. But again, keep in mind that we did have one pod left over from when we tested the other markers. So if we had used all five pods, maybe we would have gotten some higher FPS numbers. But overall, still very impressive considering what type of marker we're working with. So now we're moving into our final test where we're going to be testing the rate of fire for this marker. Now, before we start doing any rate of fire tests, there's two things you need to remember. One, when you do a rate of fire test, always try to hold down the trigger until you run out of paintballs or else you might accidentally get a lower rate of fire than you normally would. Two, don't forget to always use a chronograph because otherwise you won't be able to tell how fast your marker is firing. Now, before we begin, I'd also like to give a shout out to my friend Alex who helped me film this video. If you guys haven't seen his channel, go ahead and click the link in the description below because he has tons of great videos on YouTube. Alright, so now we're ready to begin. As you can see, we're holding down the trigger and we're trying to shoot as many balls as possible until we run out of paintballs. As you can see, we're getting around about 120 rounds per minute out of this marker which isn't too bad considering what type of marker we're working with. Now, after shooting six pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So once again, pretty decent considering what type of marker we're working with. Now, after shooting seven pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So once again, pretty consistent numbers compared to the last time around. Now, after shooting eight pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting nine pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting ten pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting eleven pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting twelve pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting thirteen pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting fourteen pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting fifteen pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting sixteen pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting seventeen pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute. So overall, pretty consistent results throughout the entire testing process. Now, after shooting eighteen pods through this marker, we were able to get an average rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and a maximum rate of fire of 125 rounds per minute.

All right, so we've got front squats now. We did four sets of eight on these. We went heavy with these. So what we're going to do is we're going to go into a drop set after this. And then we'll finish off with some leg extensions.   Okay, so we finished off our leg day with some leg extensions. Now, if you notice, when I'm doing my leg extensions, I don't go all the way down. I only go about halfway down. The reason why I do that is because it keeps constant tension on the muscle. You see, if you go all the way down, you lose tension in the muscle. So by keeping tension throughout the whole movement, you're able to get more work done. Also, another thing that I do is I use my legs to push myself up instead of using my arms. That way I'm not putting any stress on my shoulders. Another thing that I do is I squeeze at the top. That way I'm really working those quadriceps.   Hey, what's up? Fred Smalls here again. Just wanted to give you guys another tip before we end the video. When you're doing your leg extensions, you want to make sure your knees stay locked and you're squeezing at the very top. A lot of times people will let their knees buckle inward. If they do that, they're taking stress off their quadriceps and onto their knees. So make sure you lock your knees in and squeeze at the very top. It's going to allow you to work your quads harder.   One last thing I'd like to say before we end the video is... When you're doing these front squats, you want to make sure you sink your hips as low as possible. If you sink your hips below the top of your knee, then you're going to feel more of a stretch in your quad. And also, you're going to hit your glutes and your hamstrings harder. So remember, sink your hips as low as possible to get maximum stimulation on your quads. Thanks for watching. Hope you enjoyed the video. Remember, train big. Train hard. Train smart.

So when I lift heavy stuff like this, what I want to do is get down low and then put all my weight on it so that way it's not moving around too much. And then from there, you can see me putting all my weight into it. Then I just pick up with one hand at first. And then once I have both hands in it, then I start to stand up. Now if I was doing something heavier than this, what I would do is put more weight onto the object itself. So that way it doesn't move as much. But because this is lighter, I don't need to worry about that. Now another thing is... When I go back down, I always make sure my knees stay behind me. That way I don't hurt myself. Because if your knees come forward, you're gonna hurt yourself. But yeah, that's pretty much how I do it. If you ever notice, when I'm picking stuff up, I never bend over like this. Because if you bend over like this, you're gonna hurt yourself. You wanna keep your back straight. That's why I say, if you're trying to be strong, don't try to be strong by hurting yourself. Okay? So now we got some water bottles here. We're gonna see who could hold them for longest. We'll see who wins. All right.  Let's see who wins. Whoever holds these water bottles the longest will win.

At number one, we have the race that Richard Petty won his final victory in 1984 at Daytona International Speedway. It was also President Ronald Reagan's first visit to Daytona International Speedway as President. The race was held under rainy conditions with multiple rain delays and eventually ended up being rained out after three hours and 50 minutes. The race would be restarted on Sunday morning with Richard Petty leading the field to green. He led all but two laps during the restart before Jimmy Spencer took over the lead for good when he passed him on lap number 100. Spencer would go on to lead the final 100 laps before winning the Coke Zero Sugar 400 by just over three seconds. However, it was Richard Petty who took home his 200th career victory when he crossed the finish line in second place. It was also his last ever win.  And here comes Jimmy Spencer. He'll take the lead away from Richard Petty. And Jimmy Spencer will take the checkered flag. But look at this. Richard Petty is going to get his 200th career win today. That's right. His last ever win.   I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't put this race higher than number one. Well, there were two reasons. One, it wasn't really a Coke Zero Sugar 400 moment because they didn't even have Coca -Cola as a sponsor yet. Two, this race had nothing to do with Coke Zero Sugar.

So this was actually my first attempt at 280. It's pretty heavy for me. And as you can see here, it looks like it's moving really well. But then when I get down to about knee depth, you'll notice that I kind of stall out right there. And that's because I don't have enough speed in order to drive through the barbell. So what ends up happening is I end up losing all of my speed and power and just kind of stall out right there. And so this is why we need to be able to drive through our legs with our hips and knees in order to generate enough force to move the weight. Now if you look at my second attempt here, which is also at 280 pounds, you're gonna notice that I do not have any issues driving through the barbell. It moves really well. Now one thing that I did want to mention here is that when you're doing these types of exercises, especially if you're trying to build your lower body strength or even your upper body strength, you should always be wearing underwear. The reason being is because underwear will help protect your skin from getting irritated by the weights. But more importantly, underwear helps keep your muscles warm. When you wear underwear, it traps heat inside your pants, which keeps your muscles nice and warm. This allows them to contract better, allowing you to lift heavier weights. If you were to go into a competition without wearing underwear, you would probably lose around five pounds off of your squat just due to the fact that your muscles aren't warmed up properly.

And then when we get into games like this, we're able to pull through because of our practices. So I'm very proud of my teammates today. It was great. We were down 9 -8 at one point, but then we came back with two goals in overtime. And it was just awesome. We worked so hard all season long. So now we have something to show for it. It feels good. It feels amazing. We've been working so hard. It's finally paying off. Yeah, we had some really big plays from everyone. Everyone stepped up when they needed to be there. And everyone did their job. And we got out of the zone. We played zone defense. They didn't score any goals. And we won. That's how you do it. That's how you win. So we'll take it. We'll move forward. We'll keep playing well.

And that's what you want to see from your teammate when they're coming up for the final sprints. You've got to have guys like that who will go all out for their teammates. So we'll watch this unfold as they come down the hill towards the finish line. It looks like it might be a breakaway group trying to make it back into the main field. But that's not going to happen because there's too much speed behind them. They're just going to keep rolling through here. So we'll watch these two riders as they come around the corner. We saw the yellow jersey there. That was Ricardo Ricciardi. That's the Italian rider from Lampre. And then we had Santiago Botero. There's the Colombian rider. And then we also had Michael Rasmussen. So those three guys were in the breakaway group. They came up over the top of the climb. Now they're trying to make it back into the main field. But they won't be able to do so. Because again, there's so many riders in the peloton. And they're just going to roll through here. So let's watch these two riders as they come around the corner. We talked about how important it is to have a good lead -out man. Well, Michael Rasmussen has one of the best lead -out men in the world. His name is Richard Virenque. And Richard Virenque is doing everything he can to try to help Michael Rasmussen win this stage. So we'll watch these two riders as they come around the corner. As soon as they hit the straightaway, you're going to see Richard Virenque start to take off. And he's going to put himself in position for Michael Rasmussen to attack. So we'll watch these two riders as they come around the corner. As soon as they hit the straightaway, look how fast Richard Virenque goes. He puts himself in position for Michael Rasmussen to attack. And Michael Rasmussen attacks. And he gets away. So again, having a good lead -out man can really pay big dividends when you're trying to win a stage. Now, let's watch the rest of the field as they come across the line. There's the yellow jersey. There's Riccardo Ricciardi. And then we had Santiago Botero. And then we had Michael Rasmussen. So again, having a good lead -out man can really pay big dividends when you're trying to win a stage. Let's watch this again. Watch Richard Virenque as he comes around the corner. Watch how fast he goes. Look at that. Look at his power output. He's putting out some serious watts. And he's getting Michael Rasmussen into perfect position to attack. So again, having a good lead -out man can really pay big dividends when you're trying to win a stage. Let's watch this again. Watch Richard Virenque as he comes around the corner.

If you're not comfortable with it, don't even try it. Because there's no point in getting hurt. If you're not sure how to use the machine, ask somebody to show you. Don't just jump on here and start messing around. All right? That's pretty much it. Like I said, you can play around with different stance widths. You can play around with different angles. There's a lot of things you can play around with. But again, just make sure you're using good form. Make sure you're using proper technique. And that way you won't end up hurting yourself. Now, one thing I forgot to mention is... When you're coming up out of the hole, make sure you squeeze your glutes. Do not lift off the seat. A lot of people will lift their butt off the seat when they're coming up out of the hole. That's actually taking away from the exercise itself. So if you're lifting your butt off the seat, then you're taking away from the exercise. So make sure you stay down. Now, as far as reps, like I mentioned earlier, anywhere between 12 to 15 is ideal. Again, depending on where you're at in your training cycle, you may want to go heavier. You may want to go lighter. Just depends on what you're looking for. But ideally, 12 to 15 reps for three sets. And that should be enough to stimulate those muscles. Alright? Thanks for watching. Stay tuned for more videos. We've got some other ones coming out soon. We've got some new stuff coming out.

And then from there, all we're doing is jumping up onto that box. So this is really good for your glutes and hamstrings. Next movement we have is called a box jump. All we're doing here is jumping straight up off the ground onto the box. Now when we land, we want to make sure to absorb that impact by bending those knees. If not, we can get hurt. So if you notice, as soon as I hit the floor, I bend both knees so I can absorb that impact. And then once I've got myself stabilized, then I'll push myself back up again. But remember, always keep your core tight because if you let yourself go down like this, you could end up hurting your neck. So next exercise we have is called a burpee. Now what we're doing here is starting in push -up position. Jumping our feet forward, and then pushing ourselves straight up into the air. Now, if you need to modify this, you can start in squatted position instead of standing. Then you can still jump out, but you won't be able to do the full burpee.

Starting at Mount Wellington, my route took me through Cradle Mountain, Mount Field National Park and then down into the Tasmanian coastline. Cradle Mountain was one of the highlights for sure. We had amazing weather which meant we could see all the way out over Lake St Clair. From there it was down into the lakes where we were greeted by foggy mornings and windy afternoons.

I think it was like 2008 when he won his first world title. He had that big win over Kelly Slater. He went into that final against Kelly Slater and he ended up winning it. And then last year he came back again and did exactly the same thing. So you know, this place has been good to him. And hopefully he can do it one more time here. Yeah, so we're getting ready to head down to the beach right now. The waves look pretty good today. They're probably around three foot or so. It looks really fun. Just kind of a little bit of everything. You'll see some nice ones coming through. But yeah, just trying to have a lot of fun out there. Just try not to take too many waves because they're all different sizes. So you don't want to get hurt. But yeah, should be a good day.   Well, we're done surfing for the day. It was awesome. The waves were really fun. They were pumping. There was a few people out there. A couple of us managed to get some decent waves. But overall, it was a great day. Had a lot of fun. Now we're off to Sydney. Alrighty, well, we made our way down to Sydney. We stopped by Bondi Beach on the way down. Waves weren't looking too bad. Got a few good ones. But now we're here at Manly. Waves are looking even better than they were yesterday. So we're gonna give them another go.   All right, so we're having a great time here at Manly. Waves are pumping. Water feels amazing. It's a beautiful day. It's sunny. Not too windy. Great conditions. Really enjoying myself.   Well, we're wrapping things up here at Manly. Had a great time. Waves were pumping. Beautiful water. Good times.   Well, we're finishing up our trip here in Australia. We're headed home tomorrow. But before we leave, we decided to come down to Brisbane. We're staying at the beautiful Sheraton Hotel. It's right across from the beach. Waves are pumping. Weather's perfect. Can't ask for anything else.   Well, we're wrapping things up here in Brisbane. Had a great time. Waves were pumping.

And if you don't have good balance or your opponent has good balance, you can end up in some trouble. So let me show you what I mean by that. So if he goes here, he's got his hands down here. He comes around. He tries to get his leg over my head. And now look at how far back his hips are. If he doesn't have good balance, he could fall right into my lap. If I'm strong enough, I might be able to take him out. But even if not, it's very difficult for him to finish from there. Because look, all I need to do is pull myself forward. Boom! Now I'm in position where I can start attacking. Okay? So when you come through with your scissor sweep, make sure you keep yourself balanced. Keep your weight forward. Boom. That way you can finish the sweep. Get control of the arm. Finish whatever submission you want to use. Or maybe you just want to go straight to mount. Whatever works best for you. But again, make sure you stay balanced. Don't lose your balance. You know, don't put yourself in a bad position. Because again, if you're doing something like this, you're putting yourself in a bad situation. All right? So always make sure you stay balanced. Stay forward....", "event_id": 16}

So from here, we've got our opponent holding us down. We have no choice but to defend ourselves. We're going to use our stick as a weapon against him. What we're going to do is we're going to grab his wrist right here. Now, if he has a stick, he's going to try to hit me with it. So what I need to do is I need to keep my head up so that way I can see where he's hitting me. And as soon as I feel that impact, I'm going to block it out of the way. Okay? If he doesn't have a stick, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab his wrist and I'm going to pull him towards me. As I pull him towards me, I'm going to step back with my left foot. From there, I'm going to take my right hand and I'm going to reach around his neck and grab his collarbone. Now, if he tries to push away, that's fine.

As I pull him towards me, I'm going to step back with my left leg. From there, I'm going to reach around his neck and grab his collar bone. If he pushes away, that's fine.

So let me just go ahead and get to that right now. Alright guys, so we're starting off with some incline bench press. And as you can see here, my elbows are pretty much locked out at this point. That's why my triceps are doing most of the work. But yeah, I did three sets of eight reps for this one. It was actually quite heavy for me considering how long it had been since I last did triceps. So yeah, definitely felt good. My triceps were burning by the end of these sets. And then after that, we moved into some dumbbell kickbacks. And as you can see here, I have one dumbbell in each hand. And what I like about doing this exercise is that you don't really need any weight at all. You could literally use nothing if you wanted to. But I decided to add in 25 pounders just to make things more interesting. And also, because I want to build up those muscles too. But anyways, what I love about this exercise is that it allows your elbows to be locked out and therefore puts even more emphasis onto your triceps. And then after that, we went straight into some skull crushers. Now, I know there's two different ways that people perform this exercise. Some people will put their hands together and crush down towards their head. While others will keep their hands separate and crush down towards their head. Now, personally, I prefer keeping them separate because I feel like it gives me better control over the movement. And also, I find that it works better for my triceps. But anyways, moving on from there, we went straight into some overhead extensions using this machine. Now, I didn't film myself performing this exercise with free weights because there wasn't enough room for me to set up the camera. But basically, I used two 25 pound plates and performed four sets of ten reps. And then afterwards, we finished off with some pushdowns using this cable machine. And again, I only filmed myself performing this exercise using the machine because there wasn't enough room for me to set up the camera. But anyways, I hope you enjoyed today's video.

So we're going to go ahead and shoot this thing and then I'll give my final thoughts. Alright guys, so here's our first shot with the Dye M2R. And as you can tell, it shoots pretty good. It's very smooth. The trigger pull feels really nice. It has a little bit more of a clicky feel than the DSR does. And it just seems like a much better gun overall. Now, one thing that I did notice about this gun was when you were shooting rapid fire, you could hear the ball bouncing around inside the hopper quite a bit. That might be because we have a 50 ball hopper instead of a 100 ball hopper. But overall, it shot great. We had no issues at all with it. And now let me show you guys what it looks like from behind the mask. All right, so here's what it looks like from behind the mask. As you can tell, it's very comfortable. The trigger guard fits your hand perfectly. You've got these little finger holes for your thumb. So it's really easy to get a grip on this gun. And as far as the hopper goes, it's actually kind of hard to see through the hopper. Because it's such a small hole, but it works out pretty well. Overall, though, it's a great gun. It's super smooth. It's accurate. It's fast. And it's definitely worth checking out. If you want to buy one, check out the link below. Thanks again for watching.

So I'm going to go ahead and switch sides here so we're looking at it from the other side. And again, this is just a discussion about grips and how they work. It's not necessarily how to do them. It's more of what works for me. But when he goes to grab my wrist like this, what I want to do is get my elbow up high enough that his wrist is above it. And then I'll take this thumb and put it right on top of his wrist. Now, as soon as I've got him there, I'm going to start working to break him down. So as I pull back with my hand, I'm also pushing down with my knee. That way I can bring him over top of me. Now, once he gets over top of me, then I have two options. One option would be to try to pass around his head. But since we're doing a discussion about grips today, let's talk about something else. Let's say instead of grabbing my wrist, he grabs my belt. Okay? So now instead of having my arm out straight, now I need to keep my arm bent because if I let him grab my belt, he could use that for leverage against me. So I'm going to bend my elbow and make sure that his wrist is below my elbow. Then I'm going to take my thumb and place it right on top of his wrist. Again, I'm going to push with my knee while pulling back with my hand. As I do that, I'm going to turn my body so that I can hook around his leg. Once I've hooked around his leg, I'm going to sit up. As I sit up, I'm going to drop my shoulder and drive into him. At the same time, I'm going to reach across and grab his far side collar. From here, all I'm going to do is lean forward while driving my shoulder into him. That will cause him to fall backwards. When he falls backward, I'm going to step over his legs and grab his pants. With both hands, I'm going to pull him towards me. While I'm pulling him towards me, I'm going to lift my hips off the ground and throw him onto his butt. Once he lands onto his butt, I'm going to drop my weight down into him and drive my chest into his stomach. This will cause him to roll over onto his side.

And now he has no way to escape. If he tries to turn around, it's very difficult because of my knee. All right? So let's look at one more time. Let's say we're back here. I'm trying to get my head out. I'm pushing him away with my elbow. My other arm goes down. I'm rolling over top of him. My knees come together. I'm bringing my knee across his face. That makes it so he cannot turn around. If he does try to turn around, that's fine. You can go ahead and take your back or whatever else you need to do. But as soon as they start turning around, you have to make sure you keep your knee tight against their face. Okay? Because otherwise, if they turn around too much, they might be able to get their head free. But once you have them pinned like this, you should be good. They won't be able to turn around. It's really hard for them to escape. All right? So those are some things we work on today. We worked on getting our hands inside. We worked on how to pass when someone's sitting up high.

Today we're going to talk about the missing coping on this mini ramp here in Arosa. So let's get into it. I'm sure you've all seen this already if you follow my Instagram or YouTube channel. But I just want to go over some details that might not be so obvious at first glance. So let's check out what makes this ramp special and why they took away the coping. Let's do it. And by the way, if you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel for more skateboarding content. And don't forget to hit that like button as well. It really helps me out. Alright, enough talking. Let's get into it. First things first, why did they take away the coping? Well, there was some damage done from skaters who were trying to grind it. It got pretty bad actually. Yeah, it looks like someone tried to grind it right here. Look at this.  Oh yeah, look at that. That's nasty. The coping had been there since 2015 when they built this park. They didn't have any problems until recently. But now that they removed it, you can see how much better the flow is. You can just roll through without having to stop. Yeah, so before the coping was here, people would try to grind it and then they'd lose their speed because they'd have to come off the coping. Now with no coping, you can just keep your speed up and ride straight through. And it makes for a lot smoother transition from one side to the other. Now, obviously, if you're doing tricks, you'll still need something to grind on. But even if you're just cruising around, it feels great. There's also less chance of getting caught on the coping while you're riding down. Another thing that's nice about having no coping is that people aren't going to be grinding all day long. They won't have time to practice their grinds because they're too busy riding downhill. And also, you know, you could always put another piece of coping on top or something if you wanted to. Or maybe leave it blank like this. Either way, it's definitely a good idea to take away the coping. All right, so let's give it a shot. We'll start off with a little manual and then work our way up to a big old air. All right, let's see what happens. Ready?...", "event_id": 3}

And we can see that they were pretty good for Christie. They gave her a 6 .0 for artistic expression. That's the highest score given so far today. That's really high. It's not easy to get a six. It's hard to do. So Christie will be pleased with that. Her technical elements were also excellent. She got a six point four there. So overall, she has a total of twelve point four. Now let's go to Tatiana Malinina. She's from Uzbekistan. She's only seventeen years old. She won the World Junior Championships last year. She's one of the favorites here today. Let's see what the judges thought about her program. Well, she did everything perfectly except for one jump. She fell on a triple toe loop. She didn't fall on any other jumps.

And so what we did was we took some zip ties and we tied them together to make one long zip tie that could go around a branch. We found a nice low branch where we wanted to mount the camera at. And then we went ahead and tied the zip tie onto that branch. Then we put the GoPro into the selfie stick. And then we used another zip tie to attach the selfie stick to the end of the zip tie. Now we had two options here. One option was to use a tripod. But since we were going down this trail really fast, we didn't want to have any tripod or anything like that in front of us. So instead, we decided just to hold the selfie stick as we rode by. It worked out great.

She didn't have enough speed on this ball to make it all the way through. So she got lucky because it did hit one pin.

And you guys will notice that there's another horse in front of us. And she was doing really good until this point. But as soon as she saw this other horse come up behind her, she got a little spooked. She started getting a little bit excited. So what we did is we went back and forth between these two barrels. And then once she calmed down again, then we moved forward again. And you'll also notice that there's a lot of people watching us. And horses tend to be sensitive to people. So if you've ever been around a horse before, they pick up on your energy. They know when you're nervous or excited about something. So even though Cashlin didn't seem like she was too worried about all the people, Max definitely picked up on their energy. So he kind of got a little bit excited too. So we had to take some time out and calm him down before moving forward. But overall, he did pretty good. He did his first barrel pretty decently. He could have done better, but it wasn't bad at all. Now, Missy, on the other hand... Missy has never been through these barrels before. She hasn't seen them either. So she was a little bit more cautious than Cashlin at first. But once she figured out where everything was, she actually started to do pretty good. So I'm proud of both of my girls today. They both did awesome.
